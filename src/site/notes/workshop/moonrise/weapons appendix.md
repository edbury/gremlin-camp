## Weapon Mechanics

### Balance Dice

Occasionally, a weapon will be so well made that it is a joy to use—so light and balanced, it practically hits the target itself! Dwarven-made weapons, for example, are superbly crafted.

Weapons of such quality and caliber have what we call "balance dice." These are bonus dice which are added to the user's skill for all melee maneuvers involving the weapon—Strikes, Great Strikes, Blocks, Counterstrikes, Feints and Disarms. Missile and thrown weapons of Superior Quality give a balance die to the user's appropriate skill for the purposes of hitting the target. Balance dice are the same shade as the weapon.

#### Complications and Balance

If you're using the persona Complications rule and a weapon with balance dice is involved in the complication, the weapon will always lose its balance dice before being broken completely—it gets chipped or warped, rather than being snapped outright. Balance dice so lost can never be recovered.

### Melee Weapons

#### Weapon Power

All melee weapons are listed with their own Power. This is called Weapon Power, and is added to the character's own Power before the IMS is factored.

> A character with a B4 Power wielding a Long Sword (+3 Power) does a B4 Incidental, a B7 Mark and a B10 Superb.

#### Add

A player may spend his extra successes with a melee weapon on two things: location and damage. The Add number tells the player how many extra successes must be allocated to damage in order to go from an Incidental to a Mark result and from a Mark to a Superb.

> A weapon with an Add 2 requires two successes over the obstacle get from Incidental to Mark and two more over that to get to Superb (four all together).

> A sword has an Add 2. If performing an Ob 1 Strike, the player delivers a Mark hit with three successes and a Superb hit with five successes.

> If the obstacle to hit was 3 (due to penalties), five successes would give a Mark result, and seven would get a Superb.

Any successes not spent on aiming a blow must be dedicated to improving damage. There's no holding back once the swing is in motion.

#### Weapon Speed (WS)

Weapon Speed dictates how often a particular type of weapon may Strike in the exchange. Weapon speed is rated from 1 to 4 and X.

> Knives X, Fists 3, Spear 2, Mace 2, Long Sword 3, Light Axe 2, Footman's Axe 1.

The number indicates how many times the weapon can strike consecutively in a fight. X indicates that the weapon can Strike consecutively any number of times. After Striking with a weapon a number of times equal to the weapon speed, the player must take a rest action. This rest action can be any other action except Great Strike or Strike.

If you switch weapons in an exchange, you're limited to the lowest weapon speed applicable to the moment.

> If you have a sword in one hand and a knife in the other, you can Strike three times consecutively. If you have a sword and mace and you Strike two times with the sword, you must rest before you can use another Strike action—even if you want to switch to the mace.

#### Versus Armor (VA)

This attribute describes how well a weapon penetrates armor. This is discussed in the Armor and Shields section. For now, it's enough to know that the higher the VA, the better.

#### Handedness

Weapons require the use of one or two hands. One-handed weapons can be used with shields and off-handed weapons. Two-handed weapons cannot be used in that fashion.

One-handed weapons can use the Great Strike action, provided the wielder can put both hands on his weapon for this action. Thus you can't be using your off-hand for anything or be restrained or whatever in that volley. One-handed weapons can also gain a +1D to the Beat action if you have a free off-hand in that volley. Thus you cannot use another weapon, use your hand for Push, Lock or Charge or be restrained. Two-handed weapons can always Great Strike and always get +1D to the Beat action.

### Missile and Thrown Weapons

Missiles are used primarily in Range and Cover, sometimes in Fight and occasionally in other situations.

#### Bow, Crossbow and Gun Damage

Missile weapons have fixed damage. Since they are mechanical devices, they are not affected by the wielder's Power. They have their own effects. There is no Add for missile weapons, they rely on the Die of Fate to determine what kind of damage is delivered.

#### Die of Fate (DoF)

The successes over obstacle do not increase the damage stage. Instead they act as a bonus to the Die of Fate.

When a character hits with a missile or thrown weapon, we roll the DoF to see whether an Incidental, Mark or Superb hit is done. Missile weapons are slightly more unpredictable than melee weapons in this regard. But (and this is a big "but"), anyone who picks up a crossbow has a chance of inflicting serious harm on their target. Serious harm is not solely confined to the realm of the skilled user.

##### Extra Successes: Bonus to the Die of Fate

Successes over the obstacle with a missile or thrown weapon—that are not allocated to aiming—give a bonus to the DoF roll:

- One extra success gets a +1 to the DoF
- Doubling the obstacle gives +2 to the DoF
- Tripling the obstacle is +3 to the DoF

> A player's character has a hunting bow and is shooting a target at optimal range (Ob 2). She rolls four successes. That is double her obstacle. When she rolls the DoF, she adds 2 to her result.

> Alternately, our crack-shot hunter could allocate two of those successes to hit her target in the head. Her remaining success would just meet the obstacle, so she would get a normal DoF roll to determine damage.

#### Extreme Range Penalty

Missiles at extreme range suffer a -1 to the Die of Fate rolls for damage.

#### Versus Armor

Versus armor describes how well a weapon penetrates armor. The mechanics for this are described in the Armor and Shields chapter.

#### Thrown Weapons Damage

Thrown weapons differ slightly from missile weapons. Their Power is dependent on the wielder's Power.

Thrown weapons have a Weapon Power like melee weapons and use the same process to factor their IMS. However, they use the DoF to determine the actual damage delivered.
