# Inventory

In Moonrise, you can carry a limited number of items.

> The content in this section is either pulled entirely or strongly based on the rules from Torchbearer.

## Location, Item, and Space

There are six inventory locations: head, neck, hands, torso, belt and feet. Each location can hold a limited amount of equipment:

- The head and neck each features one worn slot.  
- Each hand can hold one worn slot and one carried slot.  
- The torso has three inventory slots.  
- The belt has three inventory slots for weapons, pouches, waterskins and other similar items.  
- Legs can wear pants (or similar)
- And of course you can wear something on your feet.

A backpack or satchel worn on the torso increases the number of items you can carry. You can also carry small and large sacks in hand to further expand your inventory slots.

Each piece of gear or loot is listed with an inventory requirement: how many slots it requires and where it can be packed or worn. There are four types of items: carried items, worn items, pack items and pocket items.

- **Carried** items are held in one or both hands.
  - "Wield" is a special designation for weapons that indicates how many hands are required to use the weapon in combat.
  - "Carried 4" indicates that you need two or more people to lift the item in question. Hefting these items on your own requires a Laborer test. Best lift with your legs.
  - Carried items can be packed away, but might have different inventory requirements. Consult the item description.
- **Worn** items may be placed around the neck, on the head, hands, torso, legs or feet.
  - Worn items will be listed with their applicable locations and any inventory slot requirements. Items without a listed slot number occupy the entire location: worn/head, for example.
  - Worn items can be packed away, but might have different inventory requirements. Consult the item description.
- **Pack** items are stuffed into backpacks, pouches, sacks, satchels and even the belt. The pack designation is our default inventory increment. Nearly any item can be packed, though some take more space in the pack than they do when worn or carried.
  - Most pack items can be carried. The Laborer skill provides guidelines, but absent specific guidance from the rules please use your best judgement.
- An item listed as "belt 1" can be attached to your belt.  
- **Pocket** items are small items like a key or a single gem that can be slipped into a pocket or sleeve.

### Bundled Items

Some items are small enough that multiples fit into a single slot.

For example, four torches may be bundled into pack 1.

As these items get used and depleted, their space requirement does not. An item always requires at least one slot in inventory. Bundled items cannot be placed on a belt.

### Worn Items

Clothing, armor, jewelry and other wearable items are worn in the locations listed in their inventory requirements.

- Leather armor requires one torso slot, but Plate armor requires two torso slots.
- A cloak takes up one torso slot.  
- Necklaces, torcs and brooches are worn about the neck. A ring takes up one worn slot on the hands.  
- Gloves take up both worn slots on the hands.

## Containers

Adventurers make use of a variety of containers to make their inventory more efficient and compact.

- There are two overall types: liquid containers like waterskins and bottles, and dry containers like sacks and satchels.
- Containers are each listed with their inventory capacity.

### Bottles and Waterskins

Bottles, waterskins and the like are designed to hold water or wine (or even more potent liquids).

- You may empty liquid containers and improvise storage for substances like sand or gems.

### Backpacks and Satchels

You may carry a backpack or a satchel in which to stow your gear.

- A backpack takes up two "worn" slots on your torso and contains six inventory slots. Wearing a backpack counts as a factor in Fighter and Dungeoneer tests.
- A satchel takes up one worn slot on your torso and contains three inventory slots.

### Belt

Due to a quirk of our inventory system, we consider a belt a container. Adventurers are forever hooking things and tying things onto these sturdy accoutrements.

- Your belt can hold three pack 1 or carried 1 items like a weapon, waterskin or pouch.
- Belt weapons: daggers, hand axes, maces and swords. Slings are carried in a pouch with their ammunition. Bows and crossbows require quivers for their ammunition, which can be worn on the belt.
- You cannot attach bundled pack items like rations, coins or torches to your belt. You must store them in a container like a pouch or bottle.

### Sacks within Sacks (within Sacks)

If packing full sacks in other sacks, the nested sack requires inventory space for all items. So a full small sack would take up three slots in a large sack—two for the contents and one for the sack. If you packed a second bundle like that into the same sack, it'd only cost two more inventory slots since small sacks take half a slot each (but you always round up for item slots).

## Weapons

Weapons like swords, daggers, hand axes, maces and the like may be hung from the belt.

- In order to use a weapon for combat, you must have the requisite hands free to wield it.
- If you don't have a free hand, you drop what you're holding in order to take up a weapon unless you state otherwise.

### Two-Handed Weapons

Two-handed weapons can be carried in a single hand, but may not be slung on the belt or torso. They require two hands to wield in combat.

## Pocket

What's in your pocket? Everyone has a pocket—in their pantaloons, their sleeves, their jackets or even their boots.

- Your pocket can hold one trinket-sized item like a key, a precious gem, a set of dice or a locket from your love.

If you stuff more stuff into your pocket—and who wouldn't, honestly— the game master can steal an item from your pocket as part of a twist or on a roll of 1 on a 1d6 when you fish something out of your sweaty lint-storage chamber.

## Cache

Your character might collect items they need to stash. Put 'em in their cache. Their cache lives in a long-term camp or a location in town with which they have an agreement. The cache is not carried.

- A standard cache has 12 inventory slots.  
- If you want to move items from it, you must visit the location and pack out what you can.  
- If this location is lost to a disaster or something similar, your cache is lost as well.

### Camp Cache

In camp, you must build some sort of storage. It doesn't have to be fancy: a hanging net, a hole or a space beneath a pile of stones will do.

If you hope to see your precious baubles again, we recommend mapping where you left them. But don't take our advice. What do we know?

- Creating a cache in camp costs a check.

### Town Cache

In town, you can cache your junk with your parents or friends, provided they have a home in the settlement. If you cannot access the town containing your cache, you cannot access your cache!

## Skill Gear

The inventory system is for carrying expendable supplies, extra items, treasure, weapons and armor. We assume that you're carrying another 40 pounds of junk in addition to your adventuring gear.

Space is so limited because the inventory system does not list every item your character is carrying. Omitted are all of the tools and special bits required to make use of your skills: pots for cooking, a shovel for digging, paper for writing. Since you're assumed to have these items so you can use your skills, don't worry about listing them on your character sheet; list only the extra, important stuff.

### Tools

You have the bare minimum tools needed for your skills in your pack— paper, ink, pots, pans, etc. However, this doesn't mean you can build a ship or pull an anvil out of your sock. To fully utilize the skill (for high obstacle tests) you need to be in town or a similar location.

#### Inadequate Tools

If a character lacks adequate tools for a job, treat this as a factor in the test.

If your backpack or satchel is missing, you lack adequate tools for your skills until you recover it. If your cruel game master damages your skill tools through a twist, you lack adequate tools until you repair or rebuy them. If you're attempting delicate or elaborate work in camp that requires a workshop, laboratory or foundry, you have inadequate tools.
