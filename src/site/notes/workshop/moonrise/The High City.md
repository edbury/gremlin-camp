# The High City

Perched atop the majestic cliffs overlooking the lower city, the gleaming white spires of the High City are home to the most esteemed denizens of Highwater: noble houses, trade guilds, and the revered Tower of Magisters. Here, the finer things in life are within reach for those deemed worthy to walk among the legendary. But with great prestige comes great peril, as those who rise too swiftly may find themselves targets of envious rivals.

## The Law: Official Business

Those of noble birth or with a 3D Reputation, along with their retinues, may move freely through the High City. Merchants and professionals are welcome only on business. Those of lower station without proof of purpose or an escort are swiftly ejected by the Shields.

## Locations

### Castle Valorous

An imperious fortress dominates the Highwater skyline, seat of The Benevolent King, Suzerain of all Feudor, he who defends the realm from the forces of chaos that ever threaten to encroach upon the lands of men.

#### Petition the King

In Winter, petition the king to grant you noble title, a patent of nobility, or an open game license. (Circles Ob 10)

**Petition the Monarch Lifestyle Cost:** +4

#### Attend Court

The royal court is a gathering place for the most influential figures of the realm—artisans, soldiers, nobles, seers, and mystics—all of whom have their own agendas.

Nobles are entitled to the monarch's hospitality (as a [[workshop/moonrise/Towns#Hotel\|hotel]]) without charge, but each phase requires a Circles test versus the court's Nature 10 to avoid scandal and remain in favor.

**Attend Court Lifestyle Cost:** +0

### Council Hall

Highwater is governed by the Council of Lords and Ladies, who claim descent from the ancient rulers of legend. The council administers the city's day-to-day affairs, though the Mages' influence has grown in recent years.

#### Paperwork

Visit the council hall to obtain business permits, guild licenses, deeds, and building rights. Requests are valid no more than once a year and take 3 seasons to process. Each request takes 1d3 seasons to honor, unless 'additional incentives' are offered to the bureaucrats.

### Font of Benevolence

Atop this fountain, the king has placed a golden chalice seemingly unattended. The water is clean and herb-scented.

**Drink from the Font:** +0

### Galleries

Within these vaulted arcades, the wealthiest of Feudor gather to trade relics and treasures of the past. Exhibits display artifacts from across the Twilight. The centerpiece is an ancient flying ship dangling inoperative from the lintels of the rotunda, a relic of a bygone age when such vessels sailed the skies.

#### Auction

On any given day, two items from `Loot Table 4` and one from `Loot Table 5` are shown at auction. Bidding in the auction is a special Duel of Wits: a Resources test plus Will sets the disposition.

- When determining compromise for the victorious bidder, each hit point lost becomes a +1 Lifestyle cost.

**Attend the Auction Lifestyle Cost:** +2

#### Skydock

Though tales abound of flying ships and the mythical floating [[Castle Ardmor\|Castle Ardmor]], none have been seen in living memory. The Skydock mainly serves the occasional wind-borne beast rider and makes a fine dumping site, emptying onto [[Middenmire\|Middenmire]]'s heap far, far below.

### The Jade Hand

The most exclusive lodging in all of Feudor is reserved for members of the Society of the Jade Hand. Within the walls of this heavily guarded hotel compound, members indulge their most unsavory appetites. Security and anonymity are chief concerns; the crimes on display in the Jade Hand would chill the blood of the common folk of Highwater.

#### Members Only

You must pass an Ob 8 Circles test to gain admission to the Hand for the first time. Don't fail.

**Enter the Hand Lifestyle Cost:** +4

#### Dress Code Strictly Enforce

Once a member, don a mask and robe. Reputation within the compound is tracked separately, beginning at 0. Each year during Winter, test Ritualist Ob 6. Succeed and gain +1 society Reputation and public Reputation, to a maximum of 4. All Reputation bonuses become notorious if you lose membership or betray the confidentiality of the Jade Hand.

**Pay Your Dues:** +3 Lifestyle each Winter

### The Tower Magisterium

Home of the [[Mage's Council\|Mage's Council]], this tower of wizardry is a place where the noble-born are taught the ancient arts. The Tower is a beacon of learning, where legends of old are studied and where the gifted are trained to harness the mystical energies that flow through the world.

#### Tutelage

Members may treat the Tower as an Instructor for the purpose of learning new spells and skills.

**Seek Training Lifestyle Cost:** +4 per spell or skill

### Royal Gardens

The exotic fruit orchards of the gardens yield an unending supply of fresh rations, free to all denizens of the High City. Few of the courtiers ever avail themselves of this bounty, so any scrumping will quickly attract the scrutiny of the Shields. You may hunt game in the open with a license.

**Forage in the Gardens Lifestyle Cost:** +0

### Tower of the Moon

Home of [[The Order\|The Order]] in Highwater, The Tower of the Moon is the tallest structure in the city. A place of ceremony and ritual, the tower is also an armory and barracks for wardens. Members may stay here for free, as [[workshop/moonrise/Towns#Inn\|inn]].

**Recover in the Tower Lifestyle Cost:** +0

### Treasury

The bursar-priests of the Lord of Favors keep a portion of King Benevolent's wealth in this fortress-like structure, behind steel and ward. They also maintain a network of debts and favors shared with other far-flung realms of Feudor.

#### Letter of Merit

Influential travelers may elect exchange favors with the bursars, arriving at their destination with something more suitable, minus a small fee, of course.

**Letter of Merit Lifestyle Cost:** +1 Lifestyle per 10D
