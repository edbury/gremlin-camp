# The Anatomy of Injury

## The Feel of Physical Tolerances in Burning Wheel

> The system described above is intended to be painful and ugly. Characters are meant to feel like corporal beings, vulnerable to harm. Most will suffer one good wound and find themselves unable to continue; after being pierced with a sword, a character's will to fight on drops dramatically. In game-mechanical terms: Less dice are rolled and a tough Steel test is required.

> This feel is deliberate in the mechanics and meant to set the mood of the game. Pain is a real thing for characters in this game, and it is something the players should remain aware of. It is possible, of course, to build a character who is highly resistant to pain, but he would be the anomaly and not the rule. For most of us, one good injury and we are in trouble.

## Bleeding and Deterioration

### BWG

Wounds deteriorate based on their initial severity.

- Superficial: Does not deteriorate.
- Light: Does not deteriorate.
- Midi: A midi wound must be treated before the conclusion of the session or else the wound becomes a severe wound. The wound ceases to bleed at severe.
- Severe: A severe wound must be tended to before the conclusion of the second scene after its issue or else the wound progresses to traumatic.
- Traumatic: A traumatic wound must be treated before the conclusion of the next scene or else it progresses to a mortal wound.
- Mortal: A mortally wounded character must be treated before the conclusion of this scene. If treatment hasn't begun, the character expires.

Note: Midi wounds only progress to Severe. Severe and Traumatic wounds may progress all the way to Mortal.

Bleeding may be staunched _once_ and lasts until the end of the next scene based on the following Obs (based on skill used):

- Midi: Ob 1-3
- Severe: Ob 2-4
- Traumatic: Ob 3-6
- Mortal: Ob 4-10

### Anthology

Wounds deteriorate based on their damage type. All wounds other than Superficial deteriorate.

- Abrasion: deteriorates 1 step (e.g., Light to Midi) in 1-6 days
- Slash: deteriorates 1 step in 1 day
- Puncture: deteriorates 2 steps in 2-12 hours
- Bludgeon: deteriorates 2 steps in 1-3 days
- Burn: deteriorates 3 steps in 1-6 days

## Treatment

### BWG

You cannot recover from midi through mortal wounds until you have been treated. Extra successes on the treatment test count as advantage dice for the injured character's Health test. Obstacles for treatment are based solely on skill:

Surgery < Khirurgy < Herbalism/Song of Soothing < Apothecary < Everything Else

- Superficial: Ob 1
- Light: Ob 2
- Midi: Ob 3-4
- Severe: Ob 4-8
- Traumatic: Ob 5-12
- Mortal: Ob 7-16

### Anthology

You cannot recover from light through mortal wounds until you have been treated. Extra successes on the treatment test may be spent to reduce treatment time, reduce the consequences of injury (e.g., from Severe traits to Midi traits), or grant a +1D advantage die per success to the wounded character's recovery Health test. Obstacles for treatment are based on damage type and skill interactions:

#### Field Dressing, Bloodletting, Nursing and Child Rearing

- Light: Ob 2-6
- Midi: Ob 3-7
- Severe: Ob 4-8
- Traumatic: Ob 5-9
- Mortal: Ob 6-10

#### Apothecary, Herbalism, Khirurgy, and Midwifery

- Light: Ob 1-5
- Midi: Ob 2-6
- Severe: Ob 3-7
- Traumatic: Ob 4-8
- Mortal: Ob 5-9

#### Song of Soothing

- Light: Ob 1-4
- Midi: Ob 2-5
- Severe: Ob 3-6
- Traumatic: Ob 4-7
- Mortal: Ob 5-8

#### Surgery

- Light: Ob 1-6
- Midi: Ob 2-7
- Severe: Ob 3-8
- Traumatic: Ob 4-9
- Mortal: Ob 5-10

**Note:** These groupings represent the span of possible obstacles but not a symmetry between damage types. For example, Bloodletting has a +2 Ob for punctures and Nursing has a +4 Ob.

## Failed Treatment

What happens when treatment fails?

### BWG

Consequences are based on wound level:

- Superficial: Recovery as normal.
- Light: Recovery as normal.
- Midi: Alternate treatment required. Permanently subtract 1 from an appropriate stat.
- Severe: Alternate treatment required. "The injured character is bleeding to death and better get real help quickly or he'll die!"
- Traumatic: Alternate treatment required. "The injured character is bleeding to death and better get real help quickly or he'll die!"
- Mortal: Margin of failure is subtracted from Health test for Recovery.

### Anthology

For all failures:

- Wound becomes infected, requiring additional treatment
- Increase permanent record by one level (e.g., Midi consequences to Severe)
- Increase deterioration by one step, if any steps remain
- Wounded character's recovery Health test suffers +1 Ob
- Failed treatment of a mortal wound results in death

## Recovery

### Obstacles

Health test obstacles for Recovery are the same:

- Superficial: Ob 1
- Light: Ob 2
- Midi: Ob 3
- Severe: Ob 4
- Traumatic: Ob 5
- Mortal: Ob 6

### Times

#### BWG

- Superficial
  - Successful: Immediate
  - Failed: 10-Forte hours
- Light:
  - Successful: Immediate
  - Failed: 24-Forte hours
- Midi: 2-12 weeks
- Severe: 1-3 months
- Traumatic: 2-6 months
- Mortal: ~18-20 months

Recovery margin of success may be spent to reduce the time by 10% each die.

#### Anthology

- Superficial: Immediate
- Light: 1 week
- Midi: 4 weeks
- Severe: 8 weeks
- Traumatic: 12 weeks
- Mortal: 12 months

Recovery margin of success may be spent to reduce the time by 1 increment each (week, month, etc).

## Failed Recovery

### BWG

- Superficial & Light: full Recovery time required.
- Midi, Severe, & Traumatic: full Recovery time required, half of the injury dice are permanently subtracted from a relevant stat, reduce cap of depleted stat by 1
- Mortal: all of the above at each stage

### Anthology

- Spend one margin of failure to increase the recovery time by one increment per step.
- Subtract the remaining margin of failure from the victim's Health exponent.
- Commit the "permanent record" consequence to the character's sheet:
  - Light: None
  - Midi: Scar
  - Severe: Scar, reduce stat cap by 1, new Char trait (Addled, limp, disfigured, missing digit, disturbed, emotional, complaining, faded, inured, involuntary shudders, mute, nihilistic, off-kilter, paranoid, screaming, uneasy)
  - Traumatic: Scar, reduce stat cap by 2, new Die trait (Disfigured, maimed, blind, deaf, missing hand, missing foot, cowardly, exhausted, lame, phobia, sickly, thousand-yard stare)
  - Mortal: Scar, reduce stat cap by 3, new Die trait (Problems, missing limb, broken, crippled, life is death, resigned to death, second sight, suicidal)

**Note:** the character's "permanent record" is affected by wounds regardless of success or failure; the results of Treatment and Recovery determine how much.
