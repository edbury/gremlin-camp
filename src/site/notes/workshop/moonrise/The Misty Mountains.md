# The Misty Mountains

Mountain ranges carve up the land into disparate realms, each with their own unique culture and character. The Morgeaux Pass in the nightward mountains marks the transition to the County of [[Darkovia\|Darkovia]], barely recognized as the same kingdom by the socialites of [[Duskwall\|Duskwall]]. In the south, the Metal Mountains are said to conceal ancient Dwarven Halls beneath their roots. Perhaps most crucially, the Barricade Peaks mark the separation of the Dreadlands of Mordeth from civilized lands. Were it not for their sheer impassability, the forces of Chaos would surely rush unimpeded across the land.

## Seasons

At higher altitudes, the mountains tend to be cooler than their surrounding environs, leading to colder (and more dangerous) winters and shorter summers. The spring thaw in particular can be dangerous as the melting snows cause flooding and avalanche in the passes.

## Surviving the Mountains

### Acrophobia

If forced off the road in the Misty Mountains, you can't ride. The steep inclines and dangerous ravines require an orienteer or climber to get you back on the road. Mounts with Climbing or Flying traits ignore this effect.

### Buried Alive

If you are unfortunate enough to be buried alive by an avalanche, rockslide, or cave-in, you have limited time to act before suffocating.

The first time the grind hits while you are buried alive, your Forte becomes taxed in addition to any other condition. The second time the grind hits while you are buried alive, you die of suffocation. If your heartless comrades proceed to a camp or town phase, you die of suffocation all the same.

Excavating a buried character might be a hauling test with an obstacle set by the margin of failure that resulted in the catastrophe. Add an additional factor if you are digging yourself out. Buried characters can't help each other, but they can receive certain help (Hauling, Survival, etc.) from characters above ground.

### Falling

High in the mountains you are always in danger of losing your footing and plummeting into the depths. When a terrain or weather threat attacks, explode any 6s on the roll. Anyone in the party may sacrifice an iron spike or a rope to negate this effect after the initial roll is made.

### Hypothermia

Rugged, layered clothes confer no bonus in the Mountains; they are mandatory. You require a hat or hood, shoes or boots, gloves, and a cloak or hide armor. Each party member lacking a complete outfit increases the Nature of the territory by 1.
