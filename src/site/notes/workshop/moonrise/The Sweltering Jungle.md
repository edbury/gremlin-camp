# The Sweltering Jungle

This steamy forest is a dangerous place, full of hazards that await the unprepared and inattentive. But there are many secrets to be found here for those willing to brave the oppressive heat and clouds of stinging insects: ancient cities made entirely of gemstones and plants that can cure any known disease. The scholars of the known world scoff at these rumors and call fools those who've given their lives and fortunes seeking them. Nevertheless, the Sweltering Jungle calls to those who crave adventure and the power of the unknown.

## Seasons

The tropical jungle has two seasons, a wet summer with prodigious flooding and a comparatively dry winter. Even in winter, the region sees much more rain than other areas.

## Surviving the Jungle

### Canopy

The thick jungle canopy obscures the skies. Earthbound travelers can't use astral navigation tools.

### Claustrophobia

If forced off the road in the Sweltering Jungle, you may not ride. Dense vegetation must be cleared to make any progress. You'll need a labor or survival skill to get back on the road. Mounts with the traits like Stalking, Lurking, Climbing, or Flying ignore this effect.

### Ferocity

The predators of the Sweltering Jungle are ferocious and will not hesitate to ambush campers. A successful attack by a hidden monster threat explodes any 6s rolled.

### Foul Water

In the Sweltering Jungle, the water is stagnant and fouled with disease. You need to stop and purify water to make it potable.

### Hack 'n' Slash

Vegetation grows so thick in the Sweltering Jungle that in some places, sharp tools are required to make any forward progress at all. Axes and machetes (as sabers) are preferred, but swords and other bladed weapons will do in a pinch. A party ill equipped for hacking through the brush increases the territory's Nature by 2.

### Jungle Rot

The jungle is crawling with disease and rot. The sick and injured conditions suffer an additional factor for recovery once you pass through the jungle, regardless of whether you took the condition there. If you aren't sick or injured you aren't afflicted by the additional factor.
