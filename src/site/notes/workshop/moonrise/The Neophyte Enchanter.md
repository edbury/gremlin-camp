# The Neophyte Enchanter

## Beliefs

1. I will prove my worth in the Highwater Arena by mastering implements of war through blood and spectacle.
2. I'll do anything to finish my work for Bargeld's gallery and become a great sorcerer.
3. The means to my infernal salvation lie in understanding who presides over the Twilight realm.
4. I swear to seek the secrets hidden in the dark, to understand rather than fear the unknown, and to use this knowledge in service of the realm's safety.

## Instincts

1. When I move about the city I stick to the sewers.
2. If confronted with an unknown threat, consult the texts for guidance before proceeding.
3. When my sisters rest I imbue our equipment.
4. Always get a twinge in the head from impending danger.
