# The Harvest Moon Murders

## Overview

As winter approaches and [[The Briargate\|The Briargate]] prepares to close, leaving [[workshop/moonrise/The Primeval Forest\|The Primeval Forest]] cut off from [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]], a series of brutal murders in [[workshop/moonrise/Brandonsford\|Brandonsford]] threatens to destroy the town's last chance for survival. Each faction sees the crisis differently - some seek to maintain order until spring, others plan exodus before the snows, and a desperate few see opportunity in isolation.

Meanwhile, [[Bentley\|Bentley]], keeper of [[The Clumsy Fox\|The Clumsy Fox]], uses an enchanted mirror to compel townsfolk to act on their darkest impulses. As his connection to [[The Amalgam\|The Amalgam]] grows stronger, the murders threaten to shatter not just the town's preparations for winter, but its very soul.

## Part I: Murder in Brandonsford

### The Situation

[[workshop/moonrise/The Brothers\|The Brothers]] arrive to find [[workshop/moonrise/Brandonsford\|Brandonsford]] fracturing under multiple pressures:

- Two brutal murders have destabilized local authority - [[Eric the Reeve\|Eric the Reeve]] and the head of Town Watch
- Agricultural workers strike during critical harvest time
- [[The Briargate\|The Briargate]]'s imminent closure threatens to cut the town off from [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]] entirely

#### Warden Faction Interests

- [[The Iron Will\|The Iron Will]]: Demands the murderer be found and executed before more chaos spreads. Views the killings as a direct threat to order that must be eliminated swiftly and publicly.
- [[The Moonlit Path\|The Moonlit Path]]: Seeks to heal the growing rifts between townsfolk before winter isolation tears the community apart permanently. Believes reconciliation between factions is crucial for survival.
- [[The Silent Archive\|The Silent Archive]]: Studies the strange patterns in the murders, suspecting a supernatural influence. Particularly interested in witness reports of missing time and memory gaps.
- [[The Sovereign Guard\|The Sovereign Guard]]: Under orders to ensure sufficient harvest reaches [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]] before [[The Briargate\|The Briargate]] closes, by any means necessary. Views both murders and strike as secondary to this goal.

### Brandonsford

- Population: ~200 total
    - 100 agricultural workers
    - 30 craftspeople and merchants
    - 20 town leadership/essential roles
    - 50 children
- The town relies on good harvests to:
    - Feed its own population through winter
    - Supply surrounding villages
    - Meet The Capital's tribute demands
- Primary exports: Grain, root vegetables, preserved meats
- Recent troubles:
    - Poor harvest projections
    - Increased tribute demands
    - Dangerous wildlife near new fields
    - Growing unrest among workers

### Warden Advice

- This investigation works best paced over several sessions.
- The town teeters on the brink of chaos. While people grow hungry and neighbors murder each other senselessly, fear of [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]]'s response prompts the formation of armed factions. When pushed over the edge, encounters escalate in violence.
- Exposing [[Bentley\|Bentley]] earns some trust but doesn't end the strike. If [[The Order\|The Order]] learns of his abilities, they demand he be captured alive for study.
- During the next Town Phase, [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]] dispatches a company of knights to break the strike if [[workshop/moonrise/The Brothers\|The Brothers]] fail.

### Running the Murder Mystery

- Track time carefully. Each action and investigation takes valuable time while tensions rise.
- Present all clues clearly. The challenge isn't finding them but deciding what to do with the information.
- All NPCs except Bentley answer questions honestly, though their perspectives may be limited.
- The Brothers aren't required to solve the murders. The town can descend into chaos and/or face brutal suppression by The Order, which creates its own interesting narrative.
- If The Brothers take too long, the violence escalates. Each murder increases the likelihood of the town fracturing into hostile factions.

### Brandonsford Factions

As [[The Briargate\|The Briargate]]'s closure looms, the town has split into three main factions:

#### Moderate Faction

Led by Farmer Gill, these pragmatists seek a middle path forward:

- Maintain essential ties with [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]] while building local resilience
- Negotiate reduced tribute in exchange for reliable food supply
- Establish alternative trade routes before winter isolation
- Work with [[The Order\|The Order]] to maintain some protection

#### Exodus Faction

Under Quinn's leadership, these refugees prepare for departure:

- Liquidate assets before property values collapse
- Pool resources to buy entry into [[workshop/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]]
- Document the murders as evidence of rural collapse
- Coordinate mass evacuation before [[The Briargate\|The Briargate]] closes

#### Independence Faction

With Rachel Parque rallying support, these revolutionaries prepare for isolation:

- Build hidden stockpiles and defensive positions
- Establish links with other Forest settlements
- Develop self-sufficient food and medicine production
- Seize resources from departing families

### Crisis Timeline

#### Background (Prior to PC Arrival)

- Harvest season at critical point for winter preparation
- Current food supplies adequate but winter stores lacking

#### Immediate Timeline

Day 0 (PC arrival):

- Workers in fields but only harvesting for town needs
- Signs read "NO TRIBUTE TIL JUSTICE" and "REMEMBER THE BRIARGATE"
- Three factions holding tense public debate in town square

Day +1:

- Major trade routes secured by strikers
- Local merchants forced to declare allegiances
- Outside traders turned away from town

Day +2:

- Exodus Faction begins property assessments
- First families announce plans to leave
- Independence Faction starts secret crop cultivation

Day +4:

- Mock trial of Wren
- Moderate Faction attempts negotiation with Capital
- Independence Faction disrupts proceedings

Day +5:

- Wren's execution
- Body displayed as warning to Capital sympathizers
- First families depart for The Capital

Day +7:

- Exodus Faction begins liquidating properties
- Independence Faction seizes abandoned resources
- Moderate Faction loses influence

Day +8:

- Factions move from debate to open conflict
- Violence around resource distribution
- Town officially splits

Day +9:

- Complete breakdown of central authority
- Exodus Faction's mass departure
- Independence Faction fortifies positions

If any of the following faction leaders die, the town immediately splinters into hostile factions:

- Farmer Gill (death causes Moderate Faction to collapse, remaining members split between other factions)
- Quinn (death causes Exodus Faction to splinter, triggering mass exodus)
- Rachel Parque (death causes Independence Faction to turn violent, immediately attacking Exodus Faction)
- Should multiple leaders die, apply effects in order listed above

### The Murders

#### What's Really Happening

- Using an enchanted mirror and power drawn from The Amalgam, Bentley compels townsfolk to act on their darkest impulses. He interprets casual complaints at his tavern as genuine desires, transforming petty grievances into murderous urges.
- Victims have no memory of gazing into the mirror.
- When questioned about suspicious activity, Bentley has prepared deflections (see table).
- Bentley convinces any NPC to let him go after 1 hour of captivity.
- PCs spending time alone with Bentley must make a Will test. Failure: Character becomes convinced that killing another PC will grant them supernatural power.
- Once discovered, he attempts to flee to the Peddler's Estate. Otherwise, he plays cat-and-mouse in the town, using his mirror to turn locals hostile.

#### Murder Pattern

- After The Brothers investigate the two initial murders, a third occurs. Subsequent murders happen every 2 days.
- Crime scenes contain obvious clues in plain sight. Townsfolk answer questions honestly when asked.
- When accused, murderers immediately confess but cannot explain their actions beyond vague grievances. Most show genuine remorse and confusion, often saying "It just seemed right at the time."

#### Constructing New Murders

1. Roll for killer and victim from remaining major NPCs. If you roll someone dead or imprisoned, use the Townsperson Generator.
2. Place the crime at the victim's usual location (Day or Night), including personal effects from both murderer and victim.
3. Consider the impact of any deaths on town dynamics (see NPC death effects).
4. Marion discovers and reports new murders within hours.
5. If 7 or fewer major NPCs remain alive, the town Descends into Chaos - survivors attack strangers on sight and encounters escalate in violence.

#### Initial Crime Scenes

- The Reeve's House: A well-maintained two-story home near the town center. Clean and orderly, with separate wings for Eric and his wife. Currently silent.
    - Victim: Eric (Reeve). Clean-shaven, graying temples. Body in house - multiple stab wounds to abdomen.
    - Murderer: His wife Sarah. Early thirties, auburn hair, vacant expression. Found in her bedroom.
    - Witness - Cedric: Was delivering supplies when Sarah suddenly attacked Eric with his letter opener. She wept afterwards, inconsolable. Cedric ran to fetch the Watch. If asked: Hadn't visited The Clumsy Fox that day.
    - Clues: Half-finished ledger. Tea set for two on desk. Notes about harvest quotas crumpled in waste bin. Letter from The Capital demanding increased tribute, marked heavily in red ink. Murder occurred simultaneously with Watch Captain's death.
- Town Watch Post: Simple stone building, two cells, weapon rack (locked, containing confiscated farming implements). Watch bell on desk for raising alarm.
    - Victim: Watch Captain Mills. Gruff voice, missing two fingers, known for fair judgment. Body in General Store - severe head trauma.
    - Murderer: Wren (Watch Officer). Tall, thin, dark circles under eyes. Locked in cell.
    - Witness - Quinn: Was discussing town security when Wren attacked without warning. Quinn tried to intervene but was knocked aside. When he came to, Mills was dead. Notes that Wren and Mills were close friends, had been planning to start a farm together. Wren had been drinking heavily at The Clumsy Fox lately.
