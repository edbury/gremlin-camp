# A satchel of documents

## A Notice in the Reeve's Desk

[Official document bearing the royal seal, marked heavily in red ink]

BY ORDER OF THE BENEVOLENT KING

…the security of the Capital requires sacrifice from all loyal settlements. Brandonsford is not alone in bearing this burden…

…harvest quotas increased by 40% over previous assessments…

…the unprecedented flood of refugees seeking shelter within the Briargate strains our resources. Those settlements unable to meet their obligations will be remembered when the gates close…

[Multiple angry annotations in red ink:]

- "Impossible!"
- "Will leave nothing for winter stores"
- "Must speak with Quinn"
- "Perhaps The Magnate…"

## Cedric's List of Traitors

[Hastily scrawled on rough paper, hidden beneath shop counter]

TRAITORS:

- Rachel
- Franklin
- Quinn

## Letters Between Kagare Sohei and The Princess

### Letter from Sohei

[On delicate rice paper with a black wax seal]

Your Grace,

…the extraction from the Great Tree proceeds as planned…

…once the essence is contained, we can use the doorway to transfer it directly to the Capital…

…the creature's power could change everything, though I confess some unease about its promises…

With deepest reverence,

[signed with a stamp]

### The Princess's Response

[On royal stationery, purple ink]

Sohei,

…your concerns are noted but unnecessary. The power we extract will serve our purposes…

…the doorway is secure, and The Order remains ignorant…

…once it reaches the Capital, the righteousness of our vision will become clear…

The Princess
