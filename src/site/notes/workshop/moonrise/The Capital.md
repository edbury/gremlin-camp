# The Capital, Highwater

Those who arrive in the capital from elsewhere are often surprised by what they find. While it is in many ways the city we've all heard of in fairy stories, the reality is… messier.

**Highwater is vast.** Walls wind for leagues around the six districts of the Twilight's biggest city. Just getting across town can be a trial. It gets easier if you know your way around or you've got loot to spend.

**Highwater is opulent.** Favor and resources from the toiling peasants of the [[Countryside\|Countryside]] into the city. In the shadow of the opulent [[workshop/moonrise/The High City\|High City]], you'll find some of the poorest, most miserable wretches in all of the Twilight.

**Highwater is old.** As old as the Beforians, they say. Their ancient vaults, avenues and mansions are still down there, somewhere, in the subcity beneath the tangle of sewer tunnels. Some believe the Beforians themselves still live, decrepit liches going about their strange business beneath the earth, unaware that the world has moved on.

**Highwater is dirty.** Cram thousands of folk into close quarters, and you'll soon have mountains of filth, refuse, and especially rats. The [[Ratcatchers' Guild\|Ratcatchers' Guild]] does a fair job of keeping 'em out of the fancier districts, but they're careful not to do their job too well, lest they put themselves out of work.

**Highwater is deadly.** This is no place to let your guard down. Maniacs and grifters stalk the streets. For those without title, the [[Shields\|Shields]] are just another gang looking to shake you down. Even for those born to wealth, Highwater's a labyrinth of betrayal where assassins lurk in every alcove.

**Highwater is bustling.** Despite the risks, the city is still the best place to sniff out leads when you're looking to score big. Merchants hire mercenaries, the [[Thieves' Guild\|Thieves' Guild]] is always looking for patsies, and crimpers "recruit" able-bodied folk to crew their vessels into dangerous waters.

## Districts

Highwater's got six distinct neighborhoods, each a town unto itself with its own laws, locations, and events. They're separated by high walls, reeking canals, shadowy alleyways, and armed guards; you can't always just walk from one to another. While you're in one district, you can't access locations in any other districts.

The six districts are:

- [[_inbox/Dockshore\|Dockshore]]
- [[Middenmire\|Middenmire]]
- [[Questers\|Questers]]
- [[Scaffolding\|Scaffolding]]
- [[workshop/moonrise/Templeton\|Templeton]]
- [[workshop/moonrise/The High City\|The High City]]

## Points of Entry

Almost everyone enters the bustling metropolis from one of these three locations:

- Sea vessels arrive at the [[Customhouse\|Customhouse]] in [[_inbox/Dockshore\|Dockshore]].
- Those with the means enter through [[The King's Gate\|The King's Gate]] in [[workshop/moonrise/Templeton\|Templeton]].
- Most poor wretches just pass through [[The Drowning Gate\|The Drowning Gate]] in [[Questers\|Questers]].

## The Mean Streets

You can move from one district to another without ending the town phase, either On Foot or by means of Conveyance.

### On Foot

If you choose to walk to another district, it's free! But you need to roll a new event for each district you enter. You can't always reach an adjacent district on foot--consult the Getting Around rules for each district to see where you can walk to.

### Conveyance

You can hire a carriage, ferry, or the [[Lift\|Lift]] in certain districts. When you pay for transportation, you don't need to roll town events while traveling. Instead, test [[workshop/moonrise/favors\|favors]] against the obstacle in your current district's Getting Around section.

#### Rubbernecking

While aboard your conveyance, you may still choose to roll a new town event for each district if you want to. But beware, your conveyance may not protect you from the result.

#### Coming up short

Fail the Favors test and you may be subject to a town event, taxed Favors, or Heat as you skip out on your fare.

### Heat

It seems easy to disappear in a burg as big as Highwater, but the authorities and the locals keep close tabs on any troublemakers. Heat measures how much unwanted attention you've drawn. Subtract Reputation from (or add Notorious Reps to) your Heat to find your wanted level, which determines what type of brute tracks you down to settle the score.

| Heat | Wanted Level       | Brutes         |
| ---- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0-2  | Presumed innocent  | Nobody         |
| 3-5  | Person of interest | Local Watch |
| 6-7  | Suspect            | Shields    |
| 8+   | Fugitive           | Bounty Hunters |

There are a few ways to bring down the heat:

#### Lay Low

- There are hideouts in [[Scaffolding\|Scaffolding]] where the Shields won't go.
- Lose 1 heat, but beware: the [[Thieves' Guild\|Thieves' Guild]] has its own laws.

#### Make them Whole

- Pass a Lifestyle test to reduce Heat by the margin of success.

#### Flee the Scene

- Lose 1 Heat any time you move between districts.
- This only works while you have Heat 5 or less.

#### Skip Town

- If you've been away from town altogether for a year or more, reduce your Heat to zero upon your return.

#### Do Hard Time

- Serve out your sentence in [[Al'Khazard\|Al'Khazard]] and you'll leave with zero Heat… some day.
