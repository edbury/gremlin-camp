# The Feudal Countryside

Even the settled lands at the heart of the largest of kingdoms are dangerous for travelers. True, the lands of lawful society are free from the most dangerous monsters and megafauna, but the threats in this territory are more subtle; other folk are just as desperate as you to secure some coin and feed themselves, and those monsters that reside close to settlements have adapted nefarious habits to infiltrate and harass the good people.

## Seasons

Large, cultivated kingdoms such as the Feudal Countryside tend to emerge in temperate climates where farmland is plentiful. These lands often experience four complete seasons of very different character.

## Surviving the Countryside

### All Roads Lead Here

Roads in the Feudal Countryside are more plentiful and well-maintained than in any other region. You don't suffer any penalty for being forced off the road by threats in this territory.

### Bribes

Favors are a must for travelers through the countryside. Beyond the need to pay tolls, tithes, and bribes, there are frequent settlements with merchants eager to shore up an expedition's supplies. During an expedition conflict, the party may offer a bribe of up to 3D to re-roll up to three failed dice against folk threats or greedy monsters.

### Dressed for Success

In the Feudal Countryside, the peasantry fear and respect their betters. Wearing finery gives +1s on all actions played against folk threats.

### Rumor Travels Fast

Amongst the impoverished masses, word of a big score cannot be contained for long. Explode 6s on any roll made by a folk threat if the party is hauling 10D worth or more of valuables.
