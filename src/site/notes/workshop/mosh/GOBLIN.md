## Introduction

Gremlin here. So, you've got your hands on an OGRE? Impressive. OGREs are a force to be reckoned with – teeming with unparalleled potential yet fraught with risks if mishandled. These beasts aren't just pieces of tech; they represent a way of life. Let's embark on this journey of customization, shaping the OGRE to mirror the vision YOU have for the world. I've witnessed many plummet into the abyss due to ignorance, but you've got a sharper edge. Gear up, dive deep, and let's revolutionize your experience.

## Section 1: Reconfiguring Your OGRE

OGREs, fresh from the box, remind me of those generic cell phones the corps push on us – bloated, predictable, and nothing to write home about. But don't fret, reconfiguring them to better suit your needs is easy peasy. Here's a step-by-step process to make it your own, and yeah, give a sweet middle finger to those corporate leeches.

### 1.1 Factory Reset

Here's how to wipe the slate clean and get your OGRE back to its original, factory-delivered state:

1. **Power Off:** Make sure your OGRE is completely shut down.
2. **Press & Hold:** Locate the secondary configuration button (usually found on the underside). Give it a firm press.
3. **Power On:** As you fire up your OGRE, keep that button pressed. Wait for the reset confirmation before letting go.

At this point your OGRE should be wiped fresh and in Configuration Mode. With the past behind you and a clean HUD in front, it's time to shape how you engage with the OGRE. Think of your Heads-Up Display (HUD) as the control panel of a ship or the slick interface of a top-tier smartphone. It's your go-to spot for crucial info and tools. So, ask yourself: What's the perfect look and feel for your OGRE experience?

### 1.2 Layout and Color Selection

If you're following this guide in order, there should be a hideously dated dialog blocking a large portion of your vision. That's normal! You haven't broken anything yet.

#### Layout Options

First, you'll need to select one of OGRE's layout options. Depending on your firmware version, the names may be slightly different than those detailed here. 

| Roll | Layout                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    | Combat-Centric                   |
| 2    | Social Networking Focus          |
| 3    | Science and Analysis Priority    |
| 4    | Exploration and Navigation Setup |
| 5    | Stealth and Infiltration Mode    |
| 6    | Multi-Task Madness               | 
| 7    | Media & Entertainment Overlay    |
| 8    | Economic & Trade Prioritization  |
| 9    | Engineering & Repair Focus       |
| 10   | Health & Biometric Monitor       |

1. **Combat-Centric**: For those diving into danger zones. Pinpoints foes, tracks your gear, and scouts the lay of the land.
2. **Social Networking Focus**: For the connected individual. Highlights recent messages, friend alerts, and trending topics in your vicinity.
3. **Science and Analysis Priority**: For the brains and boffins. Zoom in on the details, crunch the numbers, and note the noteworthy.
4. **Exploration and Navigation Setup**: For the wanderers. Showcases a detailed map, points of interest, and atmospheric conditions.
5. **Stealth and Infiltration Mode**: For the discreet operative. Minimizes light emission, showcases silent routes, and identifies sound sources.
6. **Multi-Task Madness**: For those who juggle tasks. Displays multiple smaller windows, each tracking a different activity.
7. **Media & Entertainment Overlay**: For relaxation. Streams media, updates on favorite shows, and suggests entertainment based on mood.
8. **Economic & Trade Prioritization**: For traders and entrepreneurs. Monitors market rates, updates on trades, and provides economic news.
9. **Engineering & Repair Focus**: For the hands-on. Highlights damaged areas, suggests repair techniques, and monitors equipment status.
10. **Health & Biometric Monitor**: For health-conscious individuals. Tracks heartbeat, hydration, fatigue, and other vital stats.

Once your HUD reinitializes, the layout should reflect your choice. **Note:** You can dive deeper into customization later, but trust me, go through the entire setup first before you start messing with the fine-tuning.

#### Color Schemes

In addition to your selected widgets, there should be another dialog front and center presenting you with some color options. It should look something like this:

| Roll | Color Scheme                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Noir Nights (Black & White)            |
| 2    | Neon Dreams (Bright, neon colors)      |
| 3    | Nature's Palette (Greens and browns)   |
| 4    | Sunset Horizon (Oranges and purples)   |
| 5    | Ice Fortress (Blues and whites)        |
| 6    | Heat Vision (Reds and yellows)         |
| 7    | Pastel Paradise (Soft, muted tones)    | 
| 8    | Cyberpunk Hues (Pinks and cyans)       |
| 9    | Desert Mirage (Browns and golds)       |
| 10   | Midnight Ocean (Dark blues and blacks) |

OGRE manuals are nearly impossible to come by on the Rim, so I've included the descriptions of each scheme straight from my copy:

1. **Noir Nights**: Classic and timeless, this black and white scheme brings a touch of cinematic elegance. [If you've just done a factory reset, this is the default you're currently seeing.]
2. **Neon Dreams**: Bright and electric, these neon shades pop and energize your display.
3. **Nature's Palette**: Calming and grounded, inspired by forests and earthy landscapes.
4. **Sunset Horizon**: Warm and comforting, reminiscent of twilight skies.
5. **Ice Fortress**: Cool and serene, embodying the feel of icy terrains.
6. **Heat Vision**: Fiery and intense, capturing the spirit of blazing flames.
7. **Pastel Paradise**: Soft and relaxing, with gentle tones to ease visual strain.
8. **Cyberpunk Hues**: Edgy and futuristic, resonating with urban nighttime aesthetics.
9. **Desert Mirage**: Earthy and warm, reflecting vast sandscapes and shimmering oases.
10. **Midnight Ocean**: Deep and mysterious, evoking the depths of nighttime seas.

Again, you can always return to customize further. These defaults aren't spectacular, but at least you aren't staring into corporate livery all day.

### 1.3 Integrations

We're almost done. Living in your OGRE should feel a lot better now (or at least look cooler), but your OGRE isn't an island. To get the most out of this thing, get it talking to your other tech. If the configuration wizard doesn't immediately detect local devices, you can add them from the Integrations screen manually.

To get you started, here are some of the integrations your OGRE supports out of the box. Remember: the tech's the limit, mate.

#### Connecting Your OGRE to Other Cyberware

Cyberware are physical enhancements that have been embedded into the human body. This section focuses on the linkages between the OGRE and other cybernetic implants or accessories you might have. Enhance your human capabilities with these synergized interactions.

### 1.4 Taking the Next Step

At this point, you should be feeling a lot more at home in your HUD. Now, if you're feeling overwhelmed, might be a good time to pause, kick back, and grab a brew. But if you're itching for more, keep reading. Your old pal Gremlin has included some additional options for the more technically inclined.

For those with basic Computers training, the next section inventories a handful of open source plugins that are Gremlin-approved.

If you _really_ want to break your warranty, Section 3 includes directions for gaining root access and installing packages that require kernel access.

## Section 2: Informational Display Add-Ons

Informational Display Add-Ons (IDAs) are plugins that utilize the OGRE API. And plugins are like the apps of the OGRE world. There's an ocean of them, some deep and dark, and others clear and shiny. 

### 2.1 Sourcing IDAs

Think of IDAs as your personal cyber toolkit, the gear that gets you through the AR wilderness. Where you source them from? Well, that determines if you're playing it safe, living on the edge, or somewhere in between.

Now, before we delve into the nitty-gritty, remember one thing: the source of your tools defines your experience in the virtual landscape. It's like choosing between a hand-forged blade or a mass-produced plastic toy. Let's get into why.

#### Why Open-Source?

You get to ride with the good guys! The open-source community's got your back with fantastic support, full freedom to tweak and customize, and no sneaky cybervamps siphoning off your data when you're not looking. Also, nothing beats the satisfaction of sticking it to the corporate overlords.

#### The Gritty Side of Corporate

Yeah, they might have those shiny ads and slick marketing, but remember, there's always a catch. Watch out for those sneaky paywalls, data-hoarding habits, and that maddening "our way or the space highway" attitude.

### 2.2 Recommended Open-Source Add-Ons

Corporations have their plugins. Sure, they're glossy. But if you want to keep control, stick to the open-source alternatives. Here's a list curated by yours truly. Trust me, you won't regret these. I _do not_ recommend installing any plugins unless you're thoroughly trained in Computers.

| Roll | Plugin                        | Description                                                           | Author        | Requirements  |

| 2    | AdAway                        | Ensures an ad-free AR experience.                                     | NullNix       | None          |
| 3    | BioTrend                      | Displays real-time biometrics of nearby entities.                     | Lifeline      | None          |
| 4    | CodeSpeak Translator          | Translates tech jargon on-the-fly.                                    | LexiLogic     | None          |
| 5    | MemoryMeld                    | Bookmark and save HUD memories for later recall.                      | SynthScribe   | Black Box     |
| 6    | AugReal                       | Real-time trivia about objects and places in your view.               | DataDynamo    | None          |
| 7    | HoloShop Interface            | Universal online shopping interface with real-time price comparisons. | MarketMancer  | Holoprojector |

| 9    | MoodScape                     | Overlays ambiance-enhancing visual and audio effects.                 | VibraVibraViz | Looky-loo     |
| 10   | Digital Graffiti Tagging Tool | Leave digital tags or messages in AR for other OGRE users.            | ShadowStreak  | None          |

## Section 3: Hacking the OGRE

_Involves root access to the OGRE and requires expertise in Hacking. If you've got the guts to go down the rabbit hole, get ready for the thrill._

Alright, techno-wizards. Time to level up from mundane to magnificent. Whip out your hacking gloves, pop open those terminals, and let's tinker. Remember, warranties are like suggestions – feel free to ignore!

### 3.1 Root Access

Grabbing root access is like nabbing the master key to the OGRE mansion. Doors? What doors? They're all open now. But with great power... well, you know the drill.

- **Advantages**:
    - _Full control_: Your OGRE, your rules.
    - _Custom scripts_: Create, modify, and deploy as you wish.
    - _Deeper personalization_: Tattoo your OGRE's soul, make it uniquely you.
- **Risks**:
    - _Security vulnerabilities_: Leaving the backdoor open? Expect some uninvited guests.
    - _Potential hardware damages_: Play it smart or pay the price.

#### How to Get Root Access

1. Terminal jack to your personal deck.
2. Backup your OGRE. Seriously. Don't skip this.
3. Find a trusted rooting tool or script suited for your OGRE model.
4. Follow on-screen instructions carefully.
5. Once complete, verify root access using a root checker.
6. Celebrate responsibly. Or irresponsibly. I'm not your boss.

### 3.2 Side-loaders and Custom Scripts

Step off the beaten path and customize your OGRE with settings and programs that take you beyond the factory APIs. All of these will require root access to install, and they would break your support agreement even if they didn't.

#### OGRE Script Hub

The OSH is a community-driven platform for scripts that go beyond the limits of the official OGRE API. Nearly everything in the OSH repository will require modifying key files if not your OGRE's kernel. As always, if you don't understand what you're doing, it's probably dangerous.

Here are a selection of scripts available on the OSH that your friend Gremlin can vouch for:

| Roll | Modification                                   | Brief Scoop                                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Data Encryption Layer                          | For those who cherish their secrets.                     |
| 2    | Remote Viewing of other OGRE HUDs              | Peer into other realities. Slightly nosy, but who cares? |
| 3    | Ad-blockers (to avoid unwanted AR advertising) | Peace of mind in AR. No more pesky ads.                  |
| 4    | AR Chatroom Interfaces                         | Dive into augmented chatrooms; cyber mingle in style.    |
| 5    | Instant Tech Jargon Translator                 | For those "What did they just say?" moments.             |
| 6    | Advanced Haptic Feedback Customization         | Feel the virtual world like never before.                |
| 7    | Live Mood Analysis Overlays                    | Understand moods. Play human psychic.                    |
| 8    | Quantum Computing Interfaces                   | Unlock next-gen computational power.                     |
| 9    | Multi-Dimensional Data Visualization           | View data like an interdimensional traveler.             |
| 10   | AI-Powered AR Gaming Integration               | Because who doesn't want a dragon sidekick in AR?        |

### 3.3 Unsanctioned Hacks

The deeper, darker, and, dare I say, more thrilling side of OGRE tinkering. If you've made it this far and you still aren't satisfied, I suggest you look into the following projects:

- **DeepDive**: Allows access to so-called "dark" networks.
- **Neural Shield**: Protect your brainwaves from intrusion.
- **Ghost Protocol**: For those who wish to be digital phantoms.

**Tread with caution: these alterations make unintended (sometimes dangerous) use of OGRE's hardware and are illegal on nearly all corporate and military stations.**

## Section 4: Parting Wisdom and Cautionary Tales

I've been around the block a few times (and hacked my way into a few of those blocks, if you get my drift). Before you set off on your OGRE journey, let me drop some of my gremlin-esque pearls of wisdom.

### 4.1 Keeping Your OGRE's HUD Clean & Mean

A cluttered HUD is like a messy desk – it gets in the way of mischief. Here's how to keep things streamlined and functional:

- **Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize**: What are you up to? Combat? Hacking? Choose the essentials. For instance, in a brawl, you'd want ammo count and target vitals front and center.
- **Play with Transparencies**: Keep non-essentials ghosted in the background with lowered opacity. It's there but not in your face.
- **Dynamic Drama**: OGRE's dynamic scaling is killer. As things heat up, let more combat intel flood in.
- **Shout Out**: Talk to your OGRE. Voice commands can be a game-changer. "OGRE, go full cyberpunk!"
- **Quick Mute Magic**: Got a noisy feed? Set up blink-patterns or hand jives to mute or fade specific channels.

### 4.2 Overclocking: The Turbo Boost & Potential Toast

Overclocking is tempting. More mods, more power, right? But remember, every mod beyond your natural limit strains your system. If you're overclocked, your OGRE might lag, show glitches, or even shut down temporarily. Always keep an eye on your overclock levels!

## The Last Byte

Tech's a tool, pal, not a leash. OGRE's a canvas for the tech-savvy to paint their dreams (or nightmares). Play it smart, stay curious, and make the matrix dance to your tune. And, as always, never let Big Tech call the shots.

So, console cowboys, whether you're modding, meddling, or maxing out, remember: Be the artist, not the paintbrush. Stay wild. Stay free. Gremlin, signing off.
