> Blagys and Hilsenroth (2000) [...] identified seven factors distinguishing psychodynamic from cognitive-behavioral treatments. The psychodynamic therapies were characterized by (1) focus on affect and the expression of emotion; (2) exploration of the patient's efforts to avoid certain topics or engage in activities that retard therapeutic progress (i.e., work with resistance); (3) identification of patterns in the patient's actions, thoughts, feelings, experiences, and relationships (object relations); )(4) emphasis on past experiences; (5) focus on interpersonal experiences; (6) emphasis on the therapeutic relationship (transference and the working alliance); and (7) explorations of wishes, dreams, and fantasies (intrapsychic dynamics).

> When [Freud] was being simply reflective about the essence of the process, he was known to say that any line of investigation in which transference and resistance are addressed can legitimately call itself psychoanalysis. In a 1906 letter to Carl Jung, he made a serious comment—with which anyone who has experienced a transformative personal psychotherapy can resonate—that analytic treatment is essentially a cure through love.

> Freud invited his patients to recline and relax and to speak as freely as possible, reporting every thought and feeling as it made its appearance in their consciousness. He tried to listen with a trance-like receptiveness ("[[evenly hovering attention\|evenly hovering attention]]") for the themes that emerged in their free associations, to interpret their meanings, and then to convey his understanding to the analysand (the analytic patient). He soon discovered that as people tried to do this, they struggled against inhibitions about saying everything on their minds and against impediments to acting on the basis of their new insights ("[[encounters/resistance\|resistance]]"). He also learned that they persistently responded to him as if he were more like a past love object than he viewed himself as being ("[[encounters/transference\|transference]]").

> The medicalization of psychoanalysis also tilted its language toward mechanization and objectification. It has been a loss, for example, to have Freud's "it," "I," and "I above" represented by the Latin terms "id," "ego," and "superego." Personal pronouns thus morphed into abstract agencies with little subjective resonance. As Jonathan Shedler once commented to me, it is easy for most of us to relate to the distinction between "I" and "it" in ordinary speech: "I did this" is a different experience from "It came over me." The conflictedness of human psychology, the insight that the mind is not unitary but multifaceted and divided against itself, is a profound yet simple idea.

> While teaching recently in Istanbul, I was told that the Turkish language has two different words for science: *belim*, referring to the "scientific method" idealized by Western academic psychology, and *elim*, referring to the pursuit of understanding by a more observational, introspective, and associative means. Psychoanalytic scholarship is appreciated as within the domain of *elim*.

> The sense of awe is usually associated with religious themes, with the numinous realm, the place of the spirit. It is intrinsically connected with humility, the acknowledgement that human beings are, as Mark Twain observed, "the fly-speck of the universe" and that each of us is impelled by countless forces outside our own awareness and control. Awe involves the willingness to feel very small in the presence of the vast and unknowable. It is receptive, open to being moved. It bears witness. It could not be more different from the instrumental, utilitarian mind-set of the technical problem solver or from the pragmatic, can-do optimism of the man who believes himself to be completely in charge of his life. It is not antiscientific, but it defines scientific activity in much broader ways than the logical positivist who breaks huge, complex issues down into small and simple ones so that concepts can be easily operationalized and variables readily controlled. Awe allows our experience to take our breath away; it invites each client to make a fresh imprint on the soul, the psyche, of the therapist.

> "[[Overdetermination\|Overdetermination]]" refers to the observation that significant psychological problems or tendencies have more than one cause; in fact, most have a complex etiology. A symptom important enough to instigate a trip to the therapist has typically resulted from many different, interacting influences, including factors such as one's constitution, emotional makeup, developmental history, social context, identifications, reinforcement contingencies, personal values, and current stress. "[[Multiple function\|Multiple function]]" refers to the fact that any significant psychological tendency fulfills more than one unconscious function, such as to reduce anxiety, to restore self-esteem, to express an attitude that is unwelcome in one's family, to avoid temptation, and to communicate something to others.

> There is an implicit consensus in the analytic community that under the constitutional and situational conditions affecting the patient, the therapist would have become similarly symptomatic.

> Very often, the kind of change that the client originally envisioned is not the kind that occurs, only because what does occur is something the client could not have initially imagined. To move into areas that are emotionally new, the client must proceed on a kind of borrowed faith. If the practitioner proceeds with integrity, the client will eventually feel trust in the therapist as a person; the therapist, meanwhile, exemplifies faith in the client, the partnership, and the process. [...] The faith of the therapist is not attached to a particular expected outcome but to the conviction that if two people conscientiously put a certain effort in motion, a natural process of growth that has been arrested by the accidents of the patient's life thus far will be released to follow its own self-healing logic. This kind of faith assumes that the effort to pursue the truth of one's experience has intrinsic healing value.

> It is my deep conviction that the attitudes I have discussed—curiosity and awe, a respect for complexity, the disposition to identify empathically, the valuing of subjectivity and affect, an appreciation of attachment, and a capacity for faith—are worth cherishing not only as components of a therapeutic sensibility but also as correctives to some of the more estranging and deadening aspects of contemporary life. Their opposites—intellectual passivity, opinionated reductionism, emotional distancing, objectification and apathy, personal isolation and social anomie, and existential dread—have often been lamented by scholars and social critics as the price we pay for our industrialized, consumer-oriented, and technologically sophisticated cultures. The cultivation of the more vital attitudes that undergird the psychoanalytic sensibility just might be good for the postmodern soul whatever one's orientation to psychotherapy.
