> Blagys and Hilsenroth (2000) [...] identified seven factors distinguishing psychodynamic from cognitive-behavioral treatments. The psychodynamic therapies were characterized by (1) focus on affect and the expression of emotion; (2) exploration of the patient's efforts to avoid certain topics or engage in activities that retard therapeutic progress (i.e., work with resistance); (3) identification of patterns in the patient's actions, thoughts, feelings, experiences, and relationships (object relations); )(4) emphasis on past experiences; (5) focus on interpersonal experiences; (6) emphasis on the therapeutic relationship (transference and the working alliance); and (7) explorations of wishes, dreams, and fantasies (intrapsychic dynamics).

> When [Freud] was being simply reflective about the essence of the process, he was known to say that any line of investigation in which transference and resistance are addressed can legitimately call itself psychoanalysis. In a 1906 letter to Carl Jung, he made a serious comment—with which anyone who has experienced a transformative personal psychotherapy can resonate—that analytic treatment is essentially a cure through love.

> Freud invited his patients to recline and relax and to speak as freely as possible, reporting every thought and feeling as it made its appearance in their consciousness. He tried to listen with a trance-like receptiveness ("[[evenly hovering attention\|evenly hovering attention]]") for the themes that emerged in their free associations, to interpret their meanings, and then to convey his understanding to the analysand (the analytic patient). He soon discovered that as people tried to do this, they struggled against inhibitions about saying everything on their minds and against impediments to acting on the basis of their new insights ("[[encounters/resistance\|resistance]]"). He also learned that they persistently responded to him as if he were more like a past love object than he viewed himself as being ("[[encounters/transference\|transference]]").

> The medicalization of psychoanalysis also tilted its language toward mechanization and objectification. It has been a loss, for example, to have Freud's "it," "I," and "I above" represented by the Latin terms "id," "ego," and "superego." Personal pronouns thus morphed into abstract agencies with little subjective resonance. As Jonathan Shedler once commented to me, it is easy for most of us to relate to the distinction between "I" and "it" in ordinary speech: "I did this" is a different experience from "It came over me." The conflictedness of human psychology, the insight that the mind is not unitary but multifaceted and divided against itself, is a profound yet simple idea.

> While teaching recently in Istanbul, I was told that the Turkish language has two different words for science: *belim*, referring to the "scientific method" idealized by Western academic psychology, and *elim*, referring to the pursuit of understanding by a more observational, introspective, and associative means. Psychoanalytic scholarship is appreciated as within the domain of *elim*.

> The sense of awe is usually associated with religious themes, with the numinous realm, the place of the spirit. It is intrinsically connected with humility, the acknowledgement that human beings are, as Mark Twain observed, "the fly-speck of the universe" and that each of us is impelled by countless forces outside our own awareness and control. Awe involves the willingness to feel very small in the presence of the vast and unknowable. It is receptive, open to being moved. It bears witness. It could not be more different from the instrumental, utilitarian mind-set of the technical problem solver or from the pragmatic, can-do optimism of the man who believes himself to be completely in charge of his life. It is not antiscientific, but it defines scientific activity in much broader ways than the logical positivist who breaks huge, complex issues down into small and simple ones so that concepts can be easily operationalized and variables readily controlled. Awe allows our experience to take our breath away; it invites each client to make a fresh imprint on the soul, the psyche, of the therapist.
