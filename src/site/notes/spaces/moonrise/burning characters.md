# Burning Characters

Creating a character in Moonrise follows the same process as vanilla Burning Wheel - with some adjustments.

## Called by the Crown

While their gifts manifest at different times, only children are selected to join the order.

- Starting characters in Moonrise are limited to *two* lifepaths.

## The Dim Flame

Though more hospitable than the Day or Night, humans were not meant to live in the Twilight. Children selected for the order share two telltale signs of being touched by the Darkness.

### Child Prodigy

Children selected for the order display an uncanny talent for a single skill.

- Take the `Child Prodigy` trait for free.
- The related skill must be selected from skills offered by your first or second Lifepath.

> **Child Prodigy (Adjusted)** 
> 
> This trait is only available to one or two lifepath characters. The player may shade shift one skill. Abuse this at your peril.

### Corruption

These talents, however, come with a cost. Children touched by the Darkness are marked by `Corruption`.

- Take the `Corruption` trait for free.
- When calculating your starting Corruption, add +1 for the `Child Prodigy` trait.
- Rather than roll your initial Corrupted trait, add +1 and +6 to your starting Corruption score. You may select any trait from between those rows on the Corrupted Body and Soul table.

#### Starting Corruption Example

> Dolemn is starting the game as the Arcande Devotee.
> 
> He has +1 Corruption for `Gifted` and +1 Corruption for `Child Prodigy`, giving him a starting Corruption of 2.
> 
> Dolmen may select any trait from rows 3 through 8 on the Corrupted Body and Soul table.
> 
> He chooses `Palsy`. Ever since his talent revealed itself, Dolmen has suffered from severe tremors.
