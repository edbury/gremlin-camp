# Inventory

In Moonrise, you can carry a limited number of items.

There are six inventory locations: head, neck, hands, torso, belt and feet. Each location can hold a limited amount of equipment:

- The head and neck each features one worn slot.  
- Each hand can hold one worn slot and one carried slot.  
- The torso has three inventory slots.  
- The belt has three inventory slots for weapons, pouches, waterskins and other similar items.  
- Legs can wear pants (or similar)
- And of course you can wear something on your feet.

A backpack or satchel worn on the torso increases the number of items you can carry. You can also carry small and large sacks in hand to further expand your inventory slots.

Each piece of gear or loot is listed with an inventory requirement: how many slots it requires and where it can be packed or worn. There are four types of items: carried items, worn items, pack items and pocket items.

- **Carried** items are held in one or both hands.
  - "Wield" is a special designation for weapons that indicates how many hands are required to use the weapon in combat.
  - "Carried 4" indicates that you need two or more people to lift the item in question. Hefting these items on your own requires a Laborer test. Best lift with your legs.
  - Carried items can be packed away, but might have different inventory requirements. Consult the item description.
- **Worn** items may be placed around the neck, on the head, hands, torso, legs or feet.
  - Worn items will be listed with their applicable locations and any inventory slot requirements. Items without a listed slot number occupy the entire location: worn/head, for example.
  - Worn items can be packed away, but might have different inventory requirements. Consult the item description.
- **Pack** items are stuffed into backpacks, pouches, sacks, satchels and even the belt. The pack designation is our default inventory increment. Nearly any item can be packed, though some take more space in the pack than they do when worn or carried.
  - Most pack items can be carried. The Laborer skill provides guidelines, but absent specific guidance from the rules please use your best judgement.
- An item listed as "belt 1" can be attached to your belt.  
- **Pocket** items are small items like a key or a single gem that can be slipped into a pocket or sleeve.

### Black Market

If an adventurer would like to purchase an item listed as unavailable in their current settlement, they may try to find a black market vendor.

- Make a Circles test with an obstacle equal to 1 plus the listed availability number for the item in question.
- Making this test on the docks of a dilapidated port grants +1D . Also don't forget your hometown Circles bonus at level 3
- If successful, the Resources obstacle to purchase the item in question is increased by the difference in availability level.
