# Mothership

I'm currently working on notes regarding [[spaces/mosh/support/a campaign structure for Mothership\|a campaign structure for Mothership]] based on [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]].

Notes on my home campaign are filed under [[spaces/mosh/support/TFG\|The Future Game]]. The in-world database can be found at [yor.systems](https://yor.systems).

These notes are gathered under the #mosh tag.

## Bookshelf

I'm slowly organizing my Mothership resources by creator and jump cluster.
