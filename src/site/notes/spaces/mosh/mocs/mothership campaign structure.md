# Campaign structure for Mosh

A semi-signpost for building a campaign around long-term play using third-party content. The initial setup relies heavily on the [[Shipbreaker's Toolkit\|Shipbreaker's Toolkit]] (SBT) and [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] (APoF).

SBT offers four options for answering "Who pays the bills?" Answering this provides a good guideline for what campaign play will be like and what's important. The setups listed are Company, Military, Owner-Operators, and Freelancers.

Each of these also represent a faction. [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] provides excellent hooks. 

| Framework      | Faction        | Key NPC |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Company        | Teamsters      | Reidmar |
| Military       | The Foundation | Aosta   |
| Owner-Operator | The Dry Docks  | Loshe   |
| Freelance      | The Crew       | --     | 

This setup assumes that the campaign states with all options being viable, but that's a table/campaign preference.
