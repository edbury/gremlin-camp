# Campaign structure for TFG

A semi-signpost for building a campaign around long-term play using third-party content. The initial setup relies heavily on the [[Shipbreaker's Toolkit\|Shipbreaker's Toolkit]] (SBT) and [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] (APoF).

Some assumptions:

- Mothership 1E (PSG v0.10 & SBT v0.12)
- The crew is based out of [[The Dream\|The Dream]]

SBT offers four options for answering "Who pays the bills?" Answering this provides a good guideline for what campaign play will be like and what's important. The setups listed are Company, Military, Owner-Operators, and Freelancers. I assume all options are available to the party.

Each framework is tied to a faction and handler, and any future employers should map to one of these (or something custom that answers the same questions).

| Framework      | Faction        | Key NPC |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Company        | Teamsters      | Reidmar |
| Military       | The Foundation | Aosta   |
| Owner-Operator | The Dry Docks  | Loshe   |
| Freelance      | The Crew       | --      |
