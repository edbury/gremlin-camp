# Mothership

I'm currently working on notes regarding [[spaces/mosh/support/a campaign structure for Mothership\|a campaign structure for Mothership]] based on [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]].

Notes on my home campaign are filed under [[spaces/mosh/TFG\|The Future Game]].

These notes are gathered under the #mosh tag.

## Modules

I'm slowly organizing Mothership resources by creator and jump cluster.

Note: many cluster names are not official but do represent related content/stellar geography.

[ChrisAir](https://chrisair.itch.io/) curates a collection of [all Mothership modules on itch.io](https://itch.io/c/2753663/all-mothership-modules-on-itchio).

[[Leo\|Leo]] has created [an excellent inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bvQQJUjc3BNIR00NtULOM6ccArHR7Ohre4IUXCu5FyA/edit?usp=sharing) of where many modules can be acquired.
