# STARS Transit and Recruiting Services

_A framework for Mothership character progression outside of campaign play._

These guidelines provide a way for folks participating in one-shots to maintain characters across different tables.

## House rules

In order to facilitate consistent advancement, this framework relies on two optional rules from the [[encounters/Warden's Operation Manual\|Warden's Operation Manual]]: Salaries and Rapid Skill Progression.

### Salaries

> These rules are slightly modified from the WOM to focus on sessions rather than months.

Characters earn a salary based on what skills they have acquired: 

- 500cr for every Trained Skill
- 1,000cr for every Expert Skill
- 2,000cr for every Master Skill

#### Hazard Pay

Wardens can and should use Hazard Pay to indicate the level of danger at their table. This can be based on a number of factors including the module's lethality and the Warden's style.

The Hazard Pay multiplier rangers from 0-5, each increment being an additional Salary payment for the contract.

> Jane Doe is planning on running Piece by Piece. Jane knows that PxP has potential for individual death but probably not a TPK. However, Jane plays hard and expects *someone* might get blown out of an airlock. She sets the Hazard to 2. Characters will get 2 additional Salary payments if they complete the contract.

#### Jump Pay

Jump Pay can be odd to calculate outside of a campaign because the table isn't working from a shared map of the rim.

Under BYOC, Wardens can use Jump Pay to indicate how alien the destination might be. 

> Jane decides that PxP is "normal" enough that it might take place in the same system the players are departing from. She sets Jump Pay to 0.

### Rapid Skill Learning

Rapid skill learning is based on sessions rather than time. PCs can learn a **Trained Skill** in 3 sessions, an **Expert Skill** in 5 sessions, and a **Master Skill** in 10 sessions. Skill costs remain unchanged.

This way BYOC characters can unlock skills without negotiating how much time has passed between modules.

## Wardens

Running a BYOC session doesn't require any changes to your play style. However, two small pieces of prep will help:

First, decide on the Hazard Level and Jump Pay up front. Announcing these ahead of time will give prospective players a sense of how much they stand to make, how lethal the contract is, and how weird things might get.

Second, if any of your players are bringing a legacy character, take a quick look over their sheet. They may have gear or conditions from previous missions you may want to account for or request they leave behind.

You're also free to set a cap on the High Score of participating characters, which will provide a loose ceiling for player power level.

Imagining that your PCs are looking over the station's job board, a standardized contract might look something like this:

```
Piece by Piece

Location: Daedalus Robotics Lab
Hazard: 2
Jumps: 0
Players: 3-5
High Score Limit: 5
```

## Players

As with running a session, running your character doesn't require any changes. Between sessions, however, you'll have some bookkeeping to do!

I suggest keeping a small log to track the contracts your character has taken on, how much they were paid, and whether they gained any conditions.

### Before each session

After finding a suitable contract, it's helpful to share your sheet and history with the Warden. This will give them a chance to get familiar with your skillset and flag any non-standard gear you might have picked up. Space is a big place, and your cache of loot may not be suitable for every contract.

### Post-session

At the end of each session, be sure to update your sheet:

1. Get paid
2. Raise your High Score by 1
3. Mark Skill advancement (if applicable)

### Between sessions

During campaign play, characters have chances to recuperate and progress that aren't usually afforded during one-shot play. BYOC hopes to bridge this gap and give community characters a change to recuperate and grow.

A checklist for between-session solo play might look something like:

1. Take Shore Leave
  - Decide on a Port Class based on your credits available. Debt rules and NPC intervention won't be available during solo play.
  - Resolve Shore Leave as normal. We trust you.
2. Seek medical attention.
  - You'll want to heal those wounds and remove any conditions you have... if you can pay.
3. Pay for Skill Training
  - If you have the credits and you're not currently learning a skill, now is the time to pay for your training.
4. Go shopping.
  - It's time to spend those hard-earned credits.
  - Consider any items available in the PSG available at the listed price.
  

## State of this Document

This document is an early work-in-progress. I'm currently soliciting feedback from Wardens and Players to get this ready for play-testing.

### To Do

- [ ] Add sections for playing with expanded TKG content and possible shared lore. For ex, assuming Prospero's Dream as a home base for characters.
- [ ] Review all of the naming and language in this doc. Is BYOC right? Something like the Pathfinder Society might be more apt, tho this is all unofficial.
