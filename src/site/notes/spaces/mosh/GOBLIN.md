### General Tips on Maximizing OGRE's HUD with Other Gear:

With all these interconnected systems, it's easy to clutter your Heads-Up Display. Here's a quick guide on keeping things clean and efficient:

- **Prioritize Visuals**: Depending on your task, select only essential visuals. E.g., in combat, prioritize ammunition count and target stats.
    
- **Use Transparencies**: For less crucial information, reduce opacity to keep it in the background.
    
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Use the OGRE's dynamic scale feature. The closer you are to danger, the more combat-related info appears.
    
- **Voice Commands**: Make use of voice commands to quickly switch between OGRE-HUD layouts based on the situation. "OGRE, switch to hacking mode!"
    
- **Quick Mute**: Set up gestures or blink-patterns to mute or hide specific information streams.

### Warning on Overclocking with OGRE:

Overclocking is tempting. More mods, more power, right? But remember, every mod beyond your natural limit strains your system. If you're overclocked, your OGRE might lag, show glitches, or even shut down temporarily. Always keep an eye on your overclock levels!
