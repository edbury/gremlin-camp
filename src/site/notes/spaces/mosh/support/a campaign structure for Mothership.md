# Campaign structure for Mothership

```
This note is a mere seedling. With water and care, it'll become something useful one day.
```

A semi-signpost for building a campaign around long-term play using third-party content. The initial setup relies heavily on the [[encounters/Shipbreakers Toolkit\|Shipbreakers Toolkit]] (SBT) and [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] (APoF).

Some assumptions:

- Mothership 1E (PSG v0.10 & SBT v0.12)
- The crew is based out of [[The Dream\|The Dream]]

SBT offers four options for answering "Who pays the bills?" Answering this provides a good guideline for what campaign play will be like and what's important. The setups listed are Company, Military, Owner-Operators, and Freelancers. I assume all options are available to the party.

Each framework is tied to a faction and handler, and any future employers should map to one of these (or something custom that answers the same questions).

## Campaign frameworks

| Faction                | Framework      | Handler |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Teamsters Local 32819L | Company        | Reidmar |
| Tempest Company         | Military       | Cutter   |
| --                     | Owner-Operator | Loshe?   |
| The Crew               | Freelance      | --      |

## Expenses

This modified version of the table from SBT breaks down who pays for what and when.
