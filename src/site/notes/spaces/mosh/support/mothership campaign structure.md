# Campaign structure for TFG

A semi-signpost for building a campaign around long-term play using third-party content. The initial setup relies heavily on the [[Shipbreaker's Toolkit\|Shipbreaker's Toolkit]] (SBT) and [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] (APoF).

Some assumptions:

- Mothership 1E (PSG v0.10 & SBT v0.12)
- The crew is based out of [[The Dream\|The Dream]]

SBT offers four options for answering "Who pays the bills?" Answering this provides a good guideline for what campaign play will be like and what's important. The setups listed are Company, Military, Owner-Operators, and Freelancers. I assume all options are available to the party.

Each framework is tied to a faction and handler, and any future employers should map to one of these (or something custom that answers the same questions).

| Framework      | Faction        | Key NPC |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Company        | Teamsters      | Reidmar |
| Military       | The Foundation | Aosta   |
| Owner-Operator | --  | Loshe   |
| Freelance      | The Crew       | --      |

An adjusted Bills table looks like:

| Expense           | Teamsters     | The Foundation   | Loshe         | Freelance    |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Salary            | X             | X                | X             | -            |
| Hazard Pay        | Approved only | X                | Approved only | -            |
| Jump Pay          | Approved only | X                | Approved only | -            |
| Room & Board      | On ship only  | On ship and base | On ship only  | On ship only |
| Refueling         | X             | X                | X             | -            |
| Warp Cores        | Approved only | X                | Approved only | -            |

| Skill Training    | -             | Approved only    | -             | -            |
| Medical Treatment | -             | On ship and base | -             | -            |
| Equipment         | Approved only | Approved only    | -             | -            |
| Weapons           | -             | X                | -             | -             |
