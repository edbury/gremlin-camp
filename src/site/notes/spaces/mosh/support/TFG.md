# The Future Game

> Freelancers are people who have bought (or otherwise acquired) a ship on their own, and pay for everything themselves. It’s incredibly expensive and you’ll have to beg, barter, or steal credits wherever you can find them, but on the upside, you have one of the rarest things on the Rim: freedom.

This is your guide to life aboard [[The Salacious Void\|The Salacious Void]].

Our next major arc is taking the crew to the [[encounters/Dead Planet\|Dead Planet]].

## Advancement

### Skill training

We're using the **Rapid Skill Learning** option from the [[encounters/Warden's Operation Manual\|Warden's Operation Manual]]:

- Trained Skills: 3 sessions + 10kcr in materials
- Expert Skills: 5 sessions + 50kcr in materials
- Master Skills: 10 sessions + 200kcr in materials
  
Normal prerequisites still apply.

## Ship Logistics

### Fuel

In-system, ships use 1 unit of fuel for every month of space travel. Fuel usage is tabulated when the destination for a trip has been decided, and it costs 1 Fuel to change course.

Each jump to another system consumes one warp core.

#### Refueling

You refuel your ship while in port. Prices are as follows:

| Type of Fuel | Cost/unit |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Class-I      | 1kcr      |
| Class-II     | 2kcr      |
| Class-III    | 5kcr      |
| Class-IV     | 50kcr     |
| Class-V      | 100kcr    |
| Warp Core    | 1mcr      | 

##### Siphoning Fuel

Fuel from a ship one class below yours can be used on a 2:1 basis. 

Fuel from a ship one class above yours can be used on a 1:2 basis. 

All other fuel is incompatible.

### Repairs

Out-of-pocket repair costs are currently missing from the [[encounters/Shipbreakers Toolkit\|Shipbreakers Toolkit]].

Assume Major Repairs will be in the millions of credits.
