# Campaign structure for TFG

A semi-signpost for building a campaign around long-term play using third-party content. The initial setup relies heavily on the [[Shipbreaker's Toolkit\|Shipbreaker's Toolkit]] (SBT) and [[spaces/mosh/areas/sources/A Pound of Flesh\|A Pound of Flesh]] (APoF).

Some assumptions:

- Mothership 1E (PSG v0.10 & SBT v0.12)
- The crew is based out of [[The Dream\|The Dream]]

SBT offers four options for answering "Who pays the bills?" Answering this provides a good guideline for what campaign play will be like and what's important. The setups listed are Company, Military, Owner-Operators, and Freelancers. I assume all options are available to the party.

Each framework is tied to a faction and handler, and any future employers should map to one of these (or something custom that answers the same questions).

## Campaign frameworks

| Framework      | Faction        | Key NPC |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------- |
| Company        | Teamsters      | Reidmar |
| Military       | The Foundation | Aosta   |
| Owner-Operator | --  | Loshe   |
| Freelance      | The Crew       | --      |

## Expenses

### Salary

Characters earn a monthly salary based on what skills they have acquired:

- 500cr/month for every Trained Skill
- 1,000cr/month for every Expert Skill
- 2,000cr/month for every Master Skill

### Hazard Pay

Jobs have a `Hazard` rating of 0-5 that indicates the relative danger of the work. Jobs with a Hazard of 1+ include a bonus payment equal to `Hazard x Salary`.

### Jump Pay

Because time spent in hyperspace isn’t consistent, characters earn a flat Jump Pay bonus equal to Amount of Jumps x 1,000cr, regardless of the distance traveled or time spent in hyperspace.

### Refueling

Interplanetary travel can take anywhere from a few weeks to reach a nearby planet, or several years to reach the edge of the system. These trips are made via the ship’s thrusters at a cost of 1 unit of fuel for every month of space travel. Fuel usage is tabulated when the destination for a trip has been decided, and it costs 1 Fuel to change course.

#### Refuel & resupply

You refuel and resupply your ship while in port. Each Ship Class uses a different type of Fuel (Class-I ships use Class-I Fuel, Class-V ships use Class-V Fuel, etc.).

| Type of Fuel | Cost/unit |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Class-I      | 1kcr      |
| Class-II     | 2kcr      |
| Class-III    | 5kcr      |
| Class-IV     | 50kcr     |
| Class-V      | 100kcr    |
| Warp Core    | 1mcr      | 

##### Siphoning Fuel

Fuel from a ship one class below yours can be siphoned and used on a 2:1 basis. Likewise, fuel from a ship one class above yours can be used on a 1:2 basis. All other fuel is incompatible.

### Repairs

Out-of-pocket repair costs are currently missing from the Shipbreaker's Toolkit.

Assume Major Repairs will be in the millions of credits.

### Upgrades

Minor upgrades range from 40kcr to 2mcr.

Major upgrades range from 750kcr to 50mcr.

Weapons systems range from 1.5mcr to 7mcr.

### Skill training

To learn a new Skill characters need to spend the requisite amount of time and credits.

- Trained Skills: 3 sessions + 10kcr in materials
- Expert Skills: 5 sessions + 50kcr in materials
- Master Skills: 10 sessions + 200kcr in materials
  
  To train an Expert Skill requires one Trained Skill prerequisite and to train a Master Skill requires one Expert Skill prerequisite.

### Medical treatment

Treatment prices are currently being reworked for 1E. In the meantime, here are some updates from @seanmccoy on the prices listed in the PSG.

>1. Healing a Wound is like a hospital visit. It should be 3-6 months salary. 
>2. Each point of Stat/Save damage is roughly 1-2 months of salary--something like intensive physical therapy. 
>3. Removing a permanent Condition is something like 1-2 years salary--similar to the cost of years of therapy.
>4. Average salary is 2kcr/month.

### Equipment

Equipment costs range from 20cr for a wrench to 100kcr for an exoloader.

### Weapons

Weapon costs range from 50cr for ammo to 2,000cr for a pulse rifle.
