# Mistvale

## Mistvale Locations

This section details the most well-known locations in Mistvale. While some locations add new activities, the standard features for a location of that type are still available. For example, you may hire slayers at the Stake & Mallet, but you can also drink, rumor, and tell tales as you would in a standard tavern.

### Cathedral of The Burning Lord

The town's skyline is dominated by this cathedral, which is so towering and ornate as to seem incongruous with the humble wattleand-daub buildings that sprawl in its shadow.

#### Religious Services

The clergy of the cathedral will perform minor miracles in exchange for a tithe. Test Resources against an obstacle equal to twice the circle of the prayer/invocation asked.

Religious Services Resources Ob (2 each): 1st Circle, 2nd Circle, 3rd Circle, 4th Circle

#### Offer a Prayer

The lay folk often visit the shrine within the cathedral to pray for loved ones or to petition the Lords in their own defense. A modest donation to the alms box in the cathedral is recommended before petitioning the Lords for aid. Roll on the Cathedral Prayers table.

Offer a Prayer Cost: Ob 1

### Stake & Mallet (Tavern)

The oldest and largest public house in town, the Stake & Mallet is well-lit, warm and welcoming. A few hours past sundown the door is barred—no further customers are admitted and those that are locked inside will spend the night, drinking till sunrise. Anyone entering after dark but before the lock is subjected to hostile glances and invasive questions.

#### Drink

- The first drink at a tavern removes the hungry and thirsty condition. P The first drink also earns a roll on the Tavern Rumors table found in the Town Events chapter of this book.
- A second drink at the tavern may be used to make a recovery test for the angry condition with a +1D bonus.

Drinking Lifestyle Cost: +1 per drink

#### Hire Help

- At the tavern, adventurers can hire porters, sentries and guides to aid their upcoming endeavors. All such services must be paid in advance and thus add to lifestyle cost.
- To find these useful hirelings, make a Circles test using the following factors to determine the obstacle:

Hire Help Obs

Personnel; Porter (1) ; Sentry (2) ; Guide (3)

##### Porters

- A porter has Laborer 4 and helps with all tests related to the skill. 
- A porter has two available pack inventory slots in which they'll carry things for their boss.  
- A porter can be made to carry up to two slots of inventory in their hands—like a lantern or a sack of loot—but they'll drop what they're holding and run at the first sign of danger.

##### Sentries

- A sentry has Fighter 3 but will act only to protect a camp or baggage, or to avert disaster when on watch (no check required). 4 A sentry comes equipped with clothes, shoes, a satchel (containing preserved rations and a bottle of wine) and a weapon. Roll 1d6. 1-2: dagger, 3-5: staff, 6: spear.  
  - Adventurers can further equip sentries from their own supplies.
- To gain a sentry's help in a kill, capture or drive off conflict, they must be assigned a point of disposition.

##### Guides

- A guide has the Pathfinder 4 skill and an appropriate wise related to the area. They will help with journeys, but they prefer to provide aid with their appropriate "local area-wise" when traveling.
- Guides do not explore ancient ruins or plunge into dark places. 4 A guide carries a pack with one free inventory slot in which they can store something important for their boss.  
- To gain a guide's help in a flee or pursue conflict, they must be assigned a point of disposition.  

Hiring Help Lifestyle Cost: porter +1, sentry +2, guide +2

#### Hiring Slayers

In addition to the usual hirelings— porters, guards and guides—visitors to the Stake & Mallet can bend the ear of some wise old slayers.

Gain +1 on camp event rolls in addition to the benefits of a guard and a guide. This level of service doesn't come cheap—these are real professionals!

Hiring Slayers Lifestyle Cost: +3

#### Tell Tales

- Adventurers can tell true (or outrageous) tales of their spectacular adventures in the tavern to win the respect and adulation of the clientele. The locals are always hungry for new stories. The old ones get stale after a while.

  - Dwarven Halls: Ob 5  
  - Elfhome: Ob 4
  - Religious Bastion: Ob 5 
  - Remote Village: Ob 2

### Boyar's Manse

The eccentric boyar of Mistvale owns this, the largest house in town. Every day, he meets with the townsfolk to hear their grievances and settle disputes. Consult with the boyar by making an Ob 1 Peasant test, success grants +2D to one test in town.

Boyar's Manse Cost: Lifestyle +2

### Stables

In addition to boarding steeds and beasts of burden, the stables of Mistvale are known for two exceptional offerings: the region's black-coated Vanners are among the finest carriage horses in all of Feudor, and they're less expensive for being bred here. Gain +1D when haggling to purchase such a creature (a black fine horse, See Vagrants p.30).

There are also numerous traveling folk who are skilled at crafting fine caravans and vardos. These impressive vehicles are often available for purchase second-hand, and the cost of repair and maintenance is less in Mistvale than elsewhere.

The stables of Mistvale will not board monstrous mounts at any price.

### Flophouse

The utter lack of privacy in these low-end hostels is actually seen as an advantage by many frightened travelers. Watchful bunkmates may keep the black-hearted beasts from your throat, but they do little to guard your wine or the coin in your pack.
