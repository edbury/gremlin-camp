# STARS Transit and Recruiting Services

A framework for Mothership character progression outside of campaign play.

*Do you feel like you're always starting from square one? Are you tired of risking your life for credits you never seem to spend? Does shore leave seem like a distant dream?*

*Here at STARS Transit and Recruiting Services, we recognize the difficulties facing contractors today. We partner with STARS-approved employers to bring you standardized pay, on-the-job training, and guaranteed time off.*

## Contractors

### Salary

> These guidelines are adapted from the [[blooms/dormant/mosh/Wardens Operations Manual\|Wardens Operations Manual]], page 48.

STARS contractors are paid a standard salary based on their training. For every on-the-job session, you can expect:

- 500cr for every Trained Skill
- 1,000cr for every Expert Skill
- 2,000cr for every Master Skill

STARS contractors are also entitled to Hazard and Jump Pay, depending on the job. 

#### Hazard Pay

Every STARS contract is rated with a Hazard level of 1-5, which acts as a multiplier for your salary. 

*That's right! Taking on challenging and exciting work can earn you up to 5x your normal salary!*

#### Jump Pay

Every STARS contract will indicate the amount of Jumps you'll be undertaking prior to and during the job. Contractors are entitled to a 1kcr bonus _per jump_. A high jump rating may indicate work conditions extremely outside the norm.

### Skill Training

> This optional rule is taken from the [[blooms/dormant/mosh/Wardens Operations Manual\|Wardens Operations Manual]], page 52.

*Here at STARS, we embrace the methodology of Rapid Skill Learning. By following our regimented training program, you can learn a new skill over the course of a few jobs, rather than several months!*

Contractors can learn a **Trained Skill** in 3 sessions, an **Expert Skill** in 5 sessions, and a **Master Skill** in 10 sessions. 

Credit costs remain unchanged and contractors will need to purchase their own materials during Shore Leave.

## Wardens

Running a BYOC session doesn't require any changes to your play style. However, two small pieces of prep will help:

First, decide on the Hazard Level and Jump Pay up front. Announcing these ahead of time will give prospective players a sense of how much they stand to make, how lethal the contract is, and how weird things might get.

~~Second, if any of your players are bringing a legacy character, take a quick look over their sheet. They may have gear or conditions from previous missions you may want to account for or request they leave behind.~~ [This should be standardized in some way. Mission constraints, maybe. "No explosives permitted." for ex.]

~~The High Score of participating characters will provide a loose ceiling for player power level.~~ [Maybe some guidelines here. "X-Y are likely entry-level contractors."]

When contractors are looking over the station's job board, a standard job might look something like:

> Location: Daedalus Robotics Lab
> Hazard: 2
> Jumps: 0
> Players: 3-5
> 
> The Daedalus Robotics Lab is in lockdown after personnel were fatally compromised in a random incident. Reports are linking the events to a work tool found at the scene, now classified as Artifact 21. Further details are undisclosed.
> 
> Daedalus Robotics Lab's parent company, Jensen-Hung, is excited to offer an attractive opportunity to any self-motivated freelancers in the sector! Taking on the important role of Temporary Maintenance Crew, contractees are tasked with retrieving Artifact 21 for analysis. Caution is advised; discretion is enforced.
> 
> Jensen-Hung reminds its contractees that they are legally distinct from employees, and as such will receive no compensation in the event they are compromised.

## Players

I suggest keeping a small log to track the contracts a character has taken on, how much they were paid, and whether they gained any conditions.

### Before each session

Provide the Warden with a copy of your character sheet.

### Post-session

At the end of each session, update your sheet:

1. Get paid
2. Raise your High Score by 1
3. Mark Skill advancement (if applicable)

### Between sessions

During campaign play, characters have chances to recuperate and progress that aren't usually afforded during one-shot play. BYOC hopes to bridge this gap and give community characters a change to recuperate and grow.

A checklist for between-session solo play might look something like:

1. Take Shore Leave
  - Decide on a Port Class based on your available credits.
  - Resolve Shore Leave as normal.
2. Seek medical attention.
  - You'll want to heal those wounds and remove any conditions you have... if you can pay.
3. Pay for Skill Training
  - If you have the credits and you're not currently learning a skill, now is the time to pay for your training.
4. Go shopping.
  - Consider any items available in the PSG available at the listed price.

Some tables may take Shore Leave together rather than asynchronously.

#### For campaign play

Additional Shore Leave options may be available during campaign play or at a Warden's discretion. You may wish to mark these encounters in your log.
  

## State of this Document

This document is an early work-in-progress. Tone, content, and the site are likely to change a lot over time. 

### To Do

- [ ] Add sections for playing with expanded TKG content and possible shared lore. For ex, assuming Prospero's Dream as a home base for characters.
- [ ] Does ship stuff matter? Or the frame? For ex, who pays for fuel and warp cores? Maybe the _Prometheus_ in Prometheus (2012) is the best analog.
- [ ] Review all of the naming and language in this doc. Is BYOC right?
