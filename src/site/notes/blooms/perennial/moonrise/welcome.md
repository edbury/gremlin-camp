# Welcome to Moonrise

Moonrise is an open source setting and system hack for Burning Wheel Gold.

## Some lore bits

The world of Moonrise is old. Called many things by many people during many eras, it's at the end of its planetary lifecycle. The planet has becoming tidally locked to its sun, creating three large regions: Day, Twilight, and Night. For the most part, humankind has relegated itself to the Twilight, and this is where your campaign will begin.

In addition to being tidally locked, Moonrise features two other peculiarities.

### The Door is Shut

At the edge of the known past, the world became isolated from the artha cycle. Gods and spirits were given (or forced into) physical form, as the titans once had. The mortal races, severed from the other side, lost their ability to commune with the divine - or rejoin it in death.

At character creation, only [Visionary Faith] is available. [Faith in Dead Gods] may be earned in play. 

### Word is Bond

In Moonrise, giving your word functions much like a Dwarven Oath or a Summoner's Bargain. Thinking creatures will never forget a promise or debt. Promises may be sworn against one's station or one's name. By custom, most promises are sworn against one's station -- and so inherited by the next to take their place. If one should break a promise or refuse to repay a favor, they are marked as an [Oathbreaker] and known as such by all who encounter them.

#### Favors

Over generations, the Bond developed into an elaborate economy, replacing prior currencies. See [[blooms/perennial/moonrise/favors\|Favors]] for more information.
