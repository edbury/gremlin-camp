# Sergeant Doolish, Corrupt officer

"I hold up my end; I expect to receive my share."

Distant cousin to a noble family with holdings bordering Elfland, Doolish resents his station in life. Weary of dealing with an ungrateful populace as a sergeant of the Shields, he feels he is entitled to the same wealth and influence as his relatives. Perhaps this explains the whispers of corruption and conspiracy that swirl around him.

Despite the rumors—or perhaps because of them—Doolish is seen by both the Shields and the Thieves' Guild as a man who can get things done. His record of apprehending the most heinous of criminals speaks for itself.

## Beliefs

1. I deserve the same wealth and influence as my noble relatives; I'll use my position to get it.
2. The Shields and the Thieves' Guild are tools to be used for my advancement.
3. I must uncover the truth behind this palace theft to secure my position and reputation.

## Instincts

1. Always keep an eye out for opportunities to increase my wealth or influence.
2. When interrogating suspects, start with intimidation before resorting to violence.
3. If offered a bribe, consider it carefully before accepting or refusing.

## Traits

Entitled, Avaricious, Shrewd
