# Dark Alfredo, Mountebank

"Chills? Headache and a fever, you say. Might I recommend a twice-daily regimen of Spectrasol, my patented spirit cleanser."

::: hidden
A self-proclaimed "spirit-sensitive occult master," Alfredo is never seen without his opulent robe made of color-changing feathers. He plies his services to Highwater's upper crust, charging exorbitant sums for "aural rejuvenations" and "ghost enemas". He spends much of his time in the court of Castle Valorus, eagerly probing for news of the king's health. While there, he has cultivated the gratitude of some of Highwater's most influential plutocrats, who depend on him for peace of mind and relief from ailments, both real and imagined.

Alfredo is always in need of exotic ingredients, the more obscure the better. Though it hardly seems to matter to him whether the substance proves effective as a cure, it must be pure, authentic, and of provable origin. After all, he simply won't stand to be accused of mere hucksterism.
