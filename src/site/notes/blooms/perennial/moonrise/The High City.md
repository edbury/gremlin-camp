# The High City

Atop the majestic cliffs that overlook the low city, gleaming white spires are home to the wealthiest denizens of Highwater: the noble houses, the trade guilds, and the magician's collegium. Here all the finer things in life are at your fingertips; that is, if you are deemed worthy to keep company with the quality. But the harassment of wayward plebs is nothing compared to the assassin's dagger that awaits those whose fortunes have risen too quickly.

## The Law: Official Business

Those with noble status (or 3D Reputation) and their retinues may move freely through the High City. Merchants and professionals are welcome only on business. Those of lower station without proof of business or an escort will be ejected by the Shields.

## Locations

### Caste Valorous

An imperious fortress dominates the Highwater skyline, seat of The Benevolent King, Suzerain of all Feudor, he who stems the tide of chaos that waits to devour all.

#### Petition the King

In Winter, petition the king that you now title a greater rank of nobility , or an open game license. (Circles Ob 10)

**Petition the King Lifestyle Cost:** +4

### Council Hall

Highwater is nominally a free city, where the day-to-day governance is administered by a merchant council. In recent years, the king's faction has worked to undermine the council, replacing the Lords and Ladies Pretext with family members and easily-controlled cronies.

#### Paperwork

Visit the council hall to obtain business permits, guild licenses, deeds, and building rights. Requests are valid no more than once a year and take 3 seasons to process. Each request takes 1d3 seasons to honor, unless 'additional incentives' are offered to the bureaucrats.

### Font of Benevolence

Atop this fountain, the king has placed a golden chalice seemingly unattended. The water is clean and herb-scented.

**Drink from the Font:** +0

### Galleries

Within this lofty arcade Feudor's wealthiest figures gather to trade ownership of ancient relics and vast sums. Museum exhibits feature stunning examples of art and weaponry from across Venturia and down through the ages. Only an antique flying ship, dangling incongruously from the lintels of the rotunda, gives any indication of the building's bygone function as a skyport.

#### Auction

On any given day, two items from Loot Table A and one from Loot Table 5 are shown at auction. Bidding in the auction is a special Duel of Wits; Resources test is used as Will in this disposition.

**Skydock:** The hanging relic of ancient ships and the infamous floating Castle among them, have not been seen in living memory. More sky-born vessels arrive and occasionally land. The beast rider makes a fine display against emptying Middenmire's heap far, far below.

**THE GOLDEN LEASH.** The most exclusive lodging in all of Feudor is reserved for members of the Society of the Golden Leash. Within the walls of this heavily guarded hotel (SGM) compound, members, their spouses and their most unsavory appetites. Security and anonymity are chief concerns, the number of lodgers in the Golden Leash would chill the blood of the common folk of Highwater.

**Members Only:** You must pass Ob 8 Circles test to gain admission to the Feudor's high and free public house. An expired membership is a sentence to a maximum of 4 All-Precedence bonuses are lost if you lose membership or betray the confidentiality of the Golden Leash. +3 Lifestyle each Winter.

**COLLEGIUM MALEFICI.** This austere tower of wizardry is a mere outpost of the Prismatic Triumvirate of Arkhenham. Pupils are of noble stock, able to furnish the vast sums required to refine their mediocre gifts. On occasion the Collegium grants a scholarship to some prodigy whose future they glimpse in a life scrying orbs. However, they require a lifetime of servitude to repay this debt.

**Tutelage:** Treat the Collegium as an instructor for the purpose of learning new spells (DH96). Each spell costs +4 Lifestyle.

**ROYAL GARDENS.** The exotic fruit orchards of the gardens yield an unending supply of produce, feeding the entire city. Highwater's engineers have ingeniously installed aqueducts to ensure that, in times of drought, the city is well supplied with water, with any surplus granted to the Scrutiny of the Shields. You may attempt to give the king a gift or obtain noble status here, but any profit you gain is magnified with any bribes collected by the king's spies and executioners.

+4 Lifestyle as a free action to avoid scandal or complete a House Book by taking steps toward climbing the social ladder.

**GALLERIES:** The interior is lit with magical flames, illuminating halls filled with treasures from all over the world.

**MISIKKAR HALL:** An elaborate three-story structure in the center of the palace complex, Misikkar Hall is the seat of Feudor's religious hierarchy. The Synod meets twice yearly to coordinate the seasonal festivals and chart the movements of Feudor's constellations. Anyone who tithes a full Lifestyle level at this location gains 1D of Credit to obtain spiritual gifts and other treasures stored there.
