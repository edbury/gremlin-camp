# Regions

## Feudal Countryside

Even the settled lands at the heart of the largest of kingdoms are dangerous for travelers. The Feudal Countryside may be in a temperate or tropical region. It is defined by a wealthy ruling class that exploits an underclass to cultivate the land and empowers a warrior class to protect their influence. None of these folk view freelance adventurers as anything more than thieves and troublemakers.

## Grinding Ice

At the extreme edges of the Twilight, the warmth of the Burning Lord strains to reach. The vast seas freeze over, forming a joyless firmament that only a brave and hearty few could ever call home. There are persistent rumors that antediluvian ruins and expedient paths to distant realms lie somewhere, hidden, in the blinding snows of the Grinding Ice.

## Misty Mountains

Mountain ranges carve up the land into disparate realms, each with their own unique culture and character. The Morgeaux Pass into the Astronomical marks the transition to the County of Darkovia, barely recognized as the same kingdom by the socialites of Highwater. Toward the Day, the Metal Mountains conceal the vast Dwarven Halls beneath their roots. Perhaps most crucially, the Barricade Peaks mark the separation of the Dreadlands of Mordeth from civilized lands. Were it not for their sheer impassability, the forces of Chaos would rush unimpeded across the land.

## Primeval Forest

Though there are countless forests throughout the Twilight, a few loom above all others for sheer size and mystery. To the far Night, the eerie pine forests of Darkovia are called home by bloodthirsty spirits that animate the dead. To the Day, the petrified Grimwood bars the once-busy road from Highwater to the Dwarven Halls. And in the heartlands of the Twilight there is the Greenwood, where the elves dwell in their secret city awaiting the inevitable encroachment of loggers from the nearby village of Woodborough.

## Putrid Swamp

The remote villages of Shallowglade and Fishmouth are situated in the far Astronomical and Civil. To reach them, travelers must cross the Murk, a massive stretch of water-logged wetlands. What few patches of dry earth can be found are sandy and prone to dangerous sinkholes. But even more dangerous are the reptilian monsters that lurk in the muck.

## Scorching Desert

When the Old Ones still had dominion over the world, this was the green and verdant land where they made their homeâ€”or so the scholars say. Though not as inhospitable as the Day, even the most hardy vegetation struggles to survive here. Ancient cities and the tombs of forgotten heroes lie buried under the dunes, concealed by dust storms kicked up by a hot and wicked wind. Travel here at your own peril, and pray that there is a settlement beyond the next dune.

## Shimmering Vast

A mesmerizing region of The Sea, characterized by its crystal-clear waters and the ever-present glint of sunlight dancing on its surface. This part of the sea is famous for its abundant marine life, coral reefs, and hidden grottoes. Legends speak of a mysterious, luminescent city beneath the waves, visible only during the full moon. 

## Sweltering Jungle

This steamy forest is a dangerous place, full of hazards that await the unprepared and inattentive. But there are many secrets to be found here for those willing to brave the oppressive heat and clouds of stinging insects: ancient cities made entirely of gemstones and plants that can cure any known disease. The scholars of the known world scoff at these rumors and call fools those who've given their lives and fortunes seeking them. Nevertheless, the Sweltering Jungle calls to those who crave adventure and the power of the unknown.

## Trackless Steppe

At the farthest edges of most Twilight maps, there is a narrow and implausibly vague strip of land labeled "Barbaria." Cartographers know that there is land here, but it is so vast and empty that none have charted it. Perhaps because of this, denizens of the Twilight have come to view the steppe as a remote backwater. In truth, it is many times the size of their entire kingdom and home to cultures both older and more refined.

## Whirling Depths

The most feared and revered part of The Sea. It is said that the waters here are cursed, with unrelenting waves and winds that defy navigation. Ancient tales speak of a colossal sea beast guarding the entrance to a lost world. Eerie lights are often seen beneath the water's surface.
