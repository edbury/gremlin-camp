# Beryl Boldfoot, Ratcatcher General

"The work must be done, thankless though it may be."

Newly demoted to ratcatcher general, former prefect Boldfoot has a newfound respect for the difficulty of the job. This essential function of the city is now viewed with disdain even by the merchants and common folk who rely on it. Recruitment has plummeted.

Spread thin as they are, the guild no longer has the resources to deal with the waxing infestation brought on by the emergence of [[The Verminomancer\|The Verminomancer]]. All the while, [[The Knight\|The Knight]] and Benevolent's other stooges on the council have the gall to imply—without evidence—that Boldfoot is somehow colluding with the terrorist rat-lord. Pity the long-suffering Ratcatcher General!

## Beliefs

1. The Ratcatchers' Guild is essential to [[blooms/perennial/moonrise/The Capital\|The Capital]]'s wellbeing, despite the king's disdain.
2. I must find a way to combat the growing rat infestation with our limited resources.
3. [[The Verminomancer\|The Verminomancer]]'s influence must be stopped before it overwhelms the city.

## Instincts

1. Always keep an eye out for signs of rat activity, no matter where I am.
2. When faced with a challenge, approach it methodically and without complaint.
3. If accused of colluding with [[The Verminomancer\|The Verminomancer]], vehemently deny it and demand proof.

## Traits

Overworked, Unflappable, Dedicated
