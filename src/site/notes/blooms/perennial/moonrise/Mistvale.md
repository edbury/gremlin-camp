# Mistvale

Mistvale is the largest settlement in Darkovia, though it is dwarfed by comparison to the cities of Highwater and Auberon. Like all towns in the region, it is administered by the boyar who serves as an adjudicator of disputes, collector of taxes, and enforcer of the law.

The people here are mostly friendly, though fearful of the night and weary from living in a place where death stalks the wilds. They might be close-lipped upon first meeting, but generally love to drink and talk as much as anyone in the dayward counties.

## Mistvale Locations

This section details the most well-known locations in Mistvale. While some locations add new activities, the standard features for a location of that type are still available. For example, you may hire slayers at the Stake & Mallet, but you can also drink, rumor, and tell tales as you would in a standard tavern.

### Cathedral of The Burning Lord

The town's skyline is dominated by this cathedral, which is so towering and ornate as to seem incongruous with the humble wattle-and-daub buildings that sprawl in its shadow.

#### Offer a Prayer

The lay folk often visit the shrine within the cathedral to pray for loved ones or to petition the Lord in their own defense. A modest donation to the alms box in the cathedral is recommended before petitioning the Lord for aid.

### Stake & Mallet (Tavern)

The oldest and largest public house in town, the Stake & Mallet is well-lit, warm and welcoming. A few hours past sundown the door is barred—no further customers are admitted and those that are locked inside will spend the night, drinking till sunrise. Anyone entering after dark but before the lock is subjected to hostile glances and invasive questions.

#### Hiring Slayers

In addition to the usual hirelings— porters, guards and guides—visitors to the Stake & Mallet can bend the ear of some wise old slayers. These veteran adventurers can serve as both guard and guide, using their experience to keep a camp safe from all manner of vampire and lycanthrope. Gain the benefits of a guard and a guide. This level of service doesn't come cheap—these are real professionals!

### Haunted Hotel

This foreboding edifice was once a monastery populated by a handful of ascetics before a terrible tragedy befell the place. In more recent memory, an optimistic merchant appointed the building as a luxurious hotel before disappearing himself. It is now rumored that ghosts haunt the halls, driving any who dwell within it mad.

#### Stay the Night

While the locals all seem blind to the very existence of this building, none will discourage you from squatting here. Staying the night in the haunted hotel is free—or at least, it doesn't cost money.

**Stay the Night Cost:** Free!

### Fortune Teller

In a dirty alley by the docks, a frail old man huddles under a lean-to. His eyes glint in the light of a lone candle as he offers you a glimpse of your future, for a price. But be warned, foreknowledge of events can be an even greater burden than simple ignorance.

**Read the Cards Cost:** Lifestyle +1

In addition to boarding steeds and beasts of burden, the stables of Mistvale are known for two exceptional offerings: the region's black-coated Vanners are among the finest carriage horses in all of the Twilight, and they're less expensive for being bred here.

### Flophouse

The utter lack of privacy in these low-end hostels is actually seen as an advantage by many frightened travelers. Watchful bunkmates may keep the black-hearted beasts from your throat, but they do little to guard your wine or the coin in your pack.

### Inn of the Waning Moon (Inn)

Not quite so opulent as the fine hotels in the Capital, the Inn of the Waning Moon has the finest rooms available to travelers in Darkovia. The Petrus are welcoming to traveling folk, and with them come virtuoso musicians and colorful dancers. Lethea Petru presses a hand-made holy symbol of the Burning Lord into the palm of every single boarder who crosses the threshold of her inn.

### Guildhall

All the usual trades are represented by guilds in Mistvale, but the town's unique legacy has elevated three guilds in particular to prominence: the carpenter's guild known as "the stakers", the gravedigger's guild, and the silversmith's guild.

The gravedigger's guild is richest of all. Mistvale's noble and merchant families have a feverish desire for opulent tombs, which only outsiders regard as suspicious in any way.

### Market

Just near the town square, a cluster of permanent warehouses and temporary stalls forms the town market. On holidays and during the harvest, the market expands to cover the entire square.

Anything commonly for sale in markets across the Twilight can be found in Mistvale's market, but the region is renowned for the quality of certain "essentials": wolfsbane, silver daggers, garlic, stakes, mallets and holy symbols.

### Streets

The night streets of Mistvale are safer than one might imagine. Yes, there's always the threat of stalking undead looking for an easy meal—but the true danger of remaining outdoors at night is being mistaken for such a monster by one of the locals. A vampire might leave you drained but alive; a Mistvallian will make punishingly certain that you are dead.
