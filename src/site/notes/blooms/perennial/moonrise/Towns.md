# Towns

Typically, trips to town are 4 weeks long. Everyone gets 4 weeks (1 month) of practice while you're in town.

Doing stuff in town increases your Lifestyle obstacle. Drinking at the Tavern is +1, staying at the Inn is +2, etc.

Lifestyle is tested at the end of any 4-week period in town. You can stay longer, but you'll have to pay for accommodations again.

## Known Settlements

- [[blooms/perennial/moonrise/Mistvale\|Mistvale]]

## Conducting Business

### Build Kit

To build or repair items rather than buy them, rent facilities at the guild hall and then test the appropriate skills. Lifestyle cost is as described under the Guild Hall location.

### Ask Around

When asking around about a rumor about an adventure location or lost treasure, test Circles. If you have some bit of evidence—a scrap of a map, an inscription or someone who saw something—the additional information grants +1D to the Circles test.

The game master determines the obstacle based on the type of person being sought.

**Asking Around Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Do Research

When in town, adventurers can research leads, rumors, maps and bits of lore—anything they've heard or found in their travels.

Researching a lead requires access to a library, manuscripts, journals or even engravings. Libraries or their equivalent facilities can be found in the wizard's tower (relating to lore and magic), guild hall (relating to commerce and the settlement), dwarven halls (relating to the history of the settlement and ancient grudges) and Elfhome (in their dreamhouses the elves walk through many worlds).

Test Research or related academic skill.

**Doing Research Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Go Visiting

Adventurers can visit any of their contacts or relations who are currently in this town.

**Go Visiting Lifestyle Cost:** +0

### Personal Business

Personal business is the catchall category for adventurer activity in town. Any business not covered by other categories in the Conducting Business in Town section adds to lifestyle cost. If the players come up with an activity not covered here, charge them a lifestyle cost (usually 1) and determine an appropriate roll to make.

**Personal Business Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Find Someone

If the adventurers want to search for a specific person in this settlement, make a Circles test using the appropriate obstacle.

**Searching for Someone Lifestyle Cost:** +1

## Town Locations

There are 11 general locations in a town (or other settlement): flophouse, guild hall, homes, hotel, inn, market, shrine, stables, streets, tavern and temple. Each location offers its own benefits and services, and they all cost something, even if it's just dignity.

Specific towns may offer additional or alternate services.

### Chapel

A small house of worship, the chapel offers solace in a war-torn territory. The iron-forged priests can successfully repair any one piece of armor during your stay in town and will have it ready for you when you leave. However, if you fail to pay your Lifestyle cost, the priests will curse your name and keep the armor.

**Repair Armor Lifestyle Cost:** +2

### Den of Iniquity

A locale of illegal activity, the den of iniquity tempts visitors with any imaginable illicit activity for a small fee. One can sleep in small private chambers where every imaginable vice can be indulged. No free recovery here, but you may pay for any number of recovery attempts at your own expense.

**Rest and Recover Lifestyle Cost:** +3 plus 1 per additional recovery attempt.

**Illicit Activity Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Flophouse

At a flophouse, adventurers crash in the common room and don't get much else aside from fleas.

- If you are injured, mark four weeks of recovery.
- You cannot recovery from injuries or sickness here if you are Diseased.

**Flophouse Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Forge

The forge permits the Use Facilities activity of the Guild Hall but for Armorer and Weaponsmith only.

### Guild Hall
{ #9c0439}


Most towns are run by a league of powerful guilds. They control all trade and commerce and provide the town's watches. At the guild hall, you petition to use guild facilities, temporarily hire apprentices and find employment. You can also exchange loot for IOUs here.

#### Rent Facilities

- Non-guild members must pay a fee to do any work related to the guild. Once the fee is paid, the guild will begrudgingly allow use of its facilities for a short period of time. Renting guild facilities is the legal way to make trade or craft skill tests—like Armorer or Weaving—during the town phase. If one tries to sneak a repair in one's hotel room, the staff will report them, and the guild will assay a fine—an Ob 2 or 3 Favors test—that must be paid lest the adventurer be branded a shirker and outlaw! Guild fees are required for:
  - Scribing scrolls
  - Repairing armor
  - Crafting items
  - Practicing alchemy or enchanting

**Using Facilities Lifestyle Cost:** +1 per trade or craft skill test

#### Hire Apprentice

- At the guild hall, one can hire a skilled apprentice. An apprentice provides help (+1D) to a trade or craft skill. One may hire a single apprentice per stay in town.
- To check if an apprentice is available, test Circles against the appropriate modifiers.
- If a guild is on strike or any town event includes the guild, then apprentices for that guild are unavailable.

##### Hiring an Apprentice Circles Modifiers

- Laborers +1 Ob
- Craftsmen (blacksmith, carpenter, weaver, etc.) +2 Ob
- Specialists (mason, armorer, goldsmith) +3 Ob
- Educated (apothecary, scholar, cartographer) +4 Ob
- Arcane (magicians) +5 Ob

**Hire Apprentice Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Hedge Witch

Some settlements boast a local magician who has retired from adventuring and set up shop out near the hedges. They sell balms, concoctions and admixtures to the needy and the desperate. The townsfolk call them hedge witches because, due to guild prohibitions, they are forced to set up shop at the edge of town.

#### Alchemical Availability

- Selling alchemical concoctions to needy adventurers is legal. If an adventurer approaches the Hedge Witch, roll 1d6 to determine how many items from the Alchemical Agents Table are available. The game master may choose the specific items.

#### Guild Prohibitions

- Hedge witches and wizards will never cast a spell for money, or sell a truly magical item. Never. It is prohibited by their guild, from the highest lich to the lowliest apprentice. If they should be caught, they will be run out of town (and forced back into the wretched life of an adventurer) and, worse, shunned by their friends and mentors.

**Purchasing from the Hedge Witch Lifestyle Cost:** +0

### Homes

If an adventurer's relationship resides in town, they can stay with them for free.

**Homes Lifestyle Cost:** 0

### Hotel

When staying at a hotel, guests are ensconced in a private room with a private bath and private entrance. Guests are also assigned to servants to attend to them.

- Staying at the hotel grants a +1D bonus to Health tests to recover from sickness or wounds.

**Hotel Lifestyle Cost:** +3

### Infirmary

- Mark 4 weeks of recovery.
- Gain +1D to recover injury or disease.

**Infirmary Lifestyle Cost:** +2

### Inn

While staying at an inn, guests receive a private room with a shared bath and shared entrance. Each room is also assigned a servant to attend to it.

- Breakfast is provided (free recovery from hungry and thirsty).
- Injured guests may mark 8 weeks of recovery time; diseased guests mark 4.

**Inn Lifestyle Cost:** +2

### Iwan

The majestic iwan serves as a gateway to a sacred space. Inside, priests offer religious services and prayers.

**Religious Services Cost:** Pay in advance.

**Atonement Ritual Lifestyle Cost:** +3

### Market

At the market, adventurers will find all manner of goods and items for purchase. The merchants here demand payment in advance and never issue credit to deadbeat adventurers.

#### Buying from the Market

- To purchase items, test Favors using the obstacles laid out in [[blooms/perennial/moonrise/gear\|gear]].
- The game master can exclude items either due to town events or from simple mischievous intent.

**Market Buying Lifestyle Cost:** +0

#### Selling Kit or Salvage

- The market is the place to sell any salvage hauled out of the ruins:
  - If the object is valued at Favors Ob 1-3, it has no exchange value. No one wants your stinky, rusty junk.
  - If the object is valued at Favors Ob 4-7, it's worth 1D.
  - If the object is valued at Favors Ob 8+, it's worth 2D.

**Market Selling Lifestyle Cost:** +0

#### Haggling Over Prices

- If so inclined, an adventurer can haggle over prices with the shopkeepers and merchants at the market. Before beginning a spending spree or trying to sell a family heirloom, test Haggling at the market. Note that this test does increase lifestyle cost by 1, so there's some risk involved. Use the following obstacles:
  - Bustling Metropolis: Ob 4
  - Busy Crossroads: Ob 2
  - Dwarven Halls: Ob 3
  - Elfhome: Ob 5
  - Religious Bastion: Ob 3
  - Remote Village: Ob 3

- Each adventurer may haggle their own prices at the market. However, merchants will honor good deals with the person who haggled the price, not their deadbeat friends. No riding on your friend's magical haggling coattails.

**Market Haggling Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Shrine

Most settlements boast many shrines. These humble structures house a specific set of Immortals or even venerate a particular young hero. One attends shrines to leave offerings and beg for aid or provenance in an upcoming endeavor, or one leaves offerings to ameliorate the cruel vanity of the Immortals so that they do not curse one's good works.

Shrines are not attended by priests. Some have a porter who keeps and tends them, but supplicants are left to make offerings on their own. Best not to get tangled in the strands of another's fate, not even for a priest.

Shrines to the Lords of Paths and Ways—an incarnation of the Lords of Fate—are common. It's an appropriate place to make an offering to whatever immortals of travel, roads, fate, hospitality, etc. that you happen to revere.

#### Offerings

- To make an offering to the Immortals who inhabit this shrine, test the Theologian skill using the listed obstacle. Success grants a roll on the Immortal Omens table. Failure brings a condition (and roll on the table) or twist (the Immortals are deaf to your feeble cries).
- Instead of making the standard obeisances and ablutions, a supplicant may make offerings to the Captain of the Dead Ship, the Lord of Slaughter, the Lady of Enervation, etc. to turn their attention away from their endeavors. A propitiate offering is always an Ob 5 Theologian test. If successful, the player may choose whether to receive a twist or condition on one failed test in the next adventure phase. If failed, roll on the Propitiate Omens table.

**Making an Offering Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Stables

In the stables, adventurers mingle with animals to find some succor from life on the road. At least there's a roof. Guests of the stables do not mark recovery time for diseases or wounds.

#### Hiding Out

- Interested parties suffer a +1 Ob when trying to locate adventurers hiding out in the stables.

**Stables Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### The Streets

Life on the streets gives nothing but a boot to the gut and a cold patch of cobblestones to curl up on. Those who sleep on the streets do not mark recovery during this town phase.

Roll on the Streets Events table.

**Life on the Streets Lifestyle Cost:** +0 (at least it's free)

### Tavern

Travelers meet at the tavern to slake their thirst, hire help, listen to the rumor mill and boast of their great deeds.

#### Drink

- The first drink at a tavern removes the hungry and thirsty condition.
- The first drink also earns a roll on the Tavern Rumors table.
- A second drink at the tavern grants +1D to the next Circles test made.

**Drinking Lifestyle Cost:** +1 per drink

#### Hire Help

- At the tavern, adventurers can hire porters, sentries and guides to aid their upcoming endeavors. All such services must be paid in advance and thus add to lifestyle cost.
- To find these useful hirelings, make a Circles test using the following modifiers to determine the obstacle:
  - Porter +1 Ob
  - Sentry +2 Ob
  - Guide +3 Ob

##### Porters

- A porter has Laborer 4 and helps with all tests related to the skill.
- A porter has two available pack inventory slots in which they'll carry things for their boss.
- A porter can be made to carry up to two slots of inventory in their hands—like a lantern or a sack of loot—but they'll drop what they're holding and run at the first sign of danger.

##### Sentries

- A sentry has a B3 Appropriate Arms but will act only to protect a camp or baggage, or to avert disaster when on watch (no check required).
- A sentry comes equipped with clothes, shoes, a satchel (containing preserved rations and a bottle of wine) and a weapon.
  - Roll 1d6. 1-2: dagger, 3-5: staff, 6: spear
- Adventurers can further equip sentries from their own supplies.

##### Guides

- A guide has a B4 Orienteering and an appropriate wise related to the area. They will help with journeys, but they prefer to provide aid with their appropriate "local area-wise" when traveling.
- Guides do not explore ancient ruins or plunge into dark places.
- A guide carries a pack with one free inventory slot in which they can store something important for their boss.

**Hiring Help Lifestyle Cost:** porter +1, sentry +2, guide +2

#### Tell Tales

- Adventurers can tell true (or outrageous) tales of their spectacular adventures in the tavern to win the respect and adulation of the clientele. The locals are always hungry for new stories. The old ones get stale after a while.
- Make an Oratory test (or perhaps Boasting or Singing):
  - Bustling Metropolis: Ob 4
  - Busy Crossroads: Ob 3
  - Dwarven Halls: Ob 5
  - Elfhome: Ob 4
  - Religious Bastion: Ob 5
  - Remote Village: Ob 2
  - Walled Town: Ob 3
  - Wizard's Tower: Ob 4
- If passed, roll 2d6 on the Successful Telling Tales Events table. If failed, roll 2d6 on the Unsuccessful Telling Tales Events table.

##### Quit Your Bullshit

- Each time an adventurer tells tales in a particular settlement, the obstacle increases by one on the next visit, up to a max of +3 Ob.

**Telling Tales Lifestyle Cost:** +1

### Teahouse

Purchase elixirs that remove various conditions for a cost of Favors Ob 4 each.

**Trading Cost:** Pay up front.

**Drinking Lifestyle Cost:** +1 Lifestyle or Ob 4 Favors.

### Temple

Many larger settlements boast a temple to the Immortals. These sanctuaries are houses for all Immortals, though certain powers may be favored in different regions. Smoky with incense, the interior of the temple boasts many altars and images at which one can say a prayer and leave an offering.

Temples are staffed by priests, monks and other adherents to the cults of Immortals. As a rule, theurges and shamans are not considered priests and are often unwelcome in temples, for they upend the careful order of things.

To their adherents, temples provide succor and tutelage. To gain these benefits, one must first join the cult.

#### Joining a Temple Cult

- To join a cult at a temple in town requires an Ob 3 Favors test. Thereafter, you gain a 1D Affiliation and may make use of the temple's facilities: succor and tutelage. Note that temples are specific to each settlement. Joining a temple in one town does not grant membership to all temples. Joining a cult as an acolyte does not confer a holy office (priesthood).

**Joining a Temple Cult Lifestyle Cost:** +0

##### Succor

- The temple provides a cell (equivalent to a flophouse), wine and shelter from secular authorities (who may not enter the temple precincts unless invited).
- Temple membership grants access to ritual space. Purification in the ritual space grants +1D to alleviate Immortal burden.

**Taking Refuge in a Temple Lifestyle Cost:** +1
