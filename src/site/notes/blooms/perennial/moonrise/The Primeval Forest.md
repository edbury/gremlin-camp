# The Primeval Forest

Though there are countless forests throughout the Twilight, few loom above all others for sheer size and mystery. Nightward, the eerie pine forests of the Astronomical are called home by bloodthirsty spirits that animate the dead. Toward dawn, the lush Grimwood opens onto the barren steppes of the Day. And in the heartlands of the Twilight there is the Greenwood, where the folks of [[blooms/perennial/moonrise/Brandonsford\|Brandonsford]] and [[Woodborough\|Woodborough]] eke out a life among the trees.

## Seasons

The Primeval Forest experiences four complete seasons, although in the Astronomical the winter is much longer and more severe.

## Surviving the Forest

### Foliage

In summer, late spring and early fall, leaves obscure the skies, preventing earthbound travelers from using astral navigation tools. In winter, early spring, and late fall, much of the leaf cover has fallen from the trees making for good visibility.

### Exposure

Even in summer, the Twilight forests get very cold at night. The ambient moisture chills your clothes and makes nights without a campfire potentially lethal.

### Roads and Game Trails

Well-maintained roads through the forest are rare but not unheard of. Game trails and marked trails made by striders make use of the land's most traversable features. These paths work like roads, but can only accommodate a cart at most.

### Stinging Insects

Constant, stinging insects swarm the forest in all seasons save winter.

Alchemists and local Peasants can prepare a special potion that is repellant to the pests; Ob 2 to craft, pack 1 (3), a single dose protects a party for one phase.

### Undergrowth

If forced off the road in the Primeval Forest, you may not ride. Mounts with traits related to Stalking, Climbing, or Flying ignore this effect.
