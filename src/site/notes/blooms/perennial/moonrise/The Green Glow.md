# The Green Glow, Folk Hero

"Hand over the rod and nobody needs to get hurt."

This masked woman, with her glowing green armor and crystal amulet, is said to be the Guardian of Highwater. She defends the innocent and fights corruption and evil wherever they appear.

Hated by the Shields and the Thieves' Guild alike, she has effortlessly eluded them many times by diving into the harbor, scaling walls or—according to witnesses—dissolving into a mist when cornered.

The Glow often seeks out the most powerful artifacts emerging from the vaults, capturing and destroying them to keep them out of the hands of greedy and exploitative sorts. This practice has earned her a place at the top of King Benevolent's list of most reviled criminals. A 100D bounty is offered for her capture, alive or dead.

## Beliefs

1. I must protect Highwater from corruption, even if it means breaking the law.
2. Powerful artifacts are too dangerous to be left in the hands of the greedy and exploitative.
3. The Brothers might be allies in the fight against corruption; I need to learn more about them.

## Instincts

1. Always scout an area thoroughly before engaging in any heroic actions.
2. When cornered, use my powers to dissolve into mist and escape.
3. If I encounter a powerful artifact, prioritize its capture.

## Traits

Superhuman, Moral, Invulnerable
