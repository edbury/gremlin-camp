# The Neophyte

## Beliefs

1. I must help the Criminal fulfill his ghostly pact so spirits aren't able to possess him and the swords.
2. It's my duty to the kingdom to use my newfound alliance with the Mage's Council to uncover their true motives.
3. In order to manage my grave condition I must find the name of an accomplished Alchemist to teach me Alchemy.
4. I swear to seek the secrets hidden in the dark, to understand rather than fear the unknown, and to use this knowledge in service of the realm's safety.

## Instincts

1. Always keep my maps up to date.
2. If confronted with an unknown threat, consult the texts for guidance before proceeding.
3. Never leave treasure on the table.
4. Always get a twinge in the head from impending danger.
