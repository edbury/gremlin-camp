# The Neophyte

## Beliefs

1. It's my duty as Warden to do what's best for the Twilight.
2. In order to create enchantments beyond imagination I need to recruit as many Warden as I can to my cause.
3. I am Gashadakuro's final prison.
4. I swear to seek the secrets hidden in the dark, to understand rather than fear the unknown, and to use this knowledge in service of the realm's safety.

## Instincts

1. Always keep my maps up to date.
2. If confronted with an unknown threat, consult the texts for guidance before proceeding.
3. When my sisters rest I imbue our equipment.
4. Always get a twinge in the head from impending danger.
