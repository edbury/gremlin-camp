# The Page

## Beliefs

## Instincts

1. The best defense is a vicious offense; assume an aggressive stance at the start of Fight!
2. Always wear a token of the Princess's standard visibly as a sign of allegiance and to inspire loyalty.
3. If someone I love is physically threatened, interpose myself and take the blow.
