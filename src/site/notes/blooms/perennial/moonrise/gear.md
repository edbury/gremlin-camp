### Arming Jacket

Worn under chain or plate, an arming jacket acts as leather armor once the chain or plate is damaged. When worn under chain, it is worn/torso 1 (in addition to the chain armor). If worn under plate, there is no additional inventory requirement. Must be custom-made for the bearer and counts as leather armor for restrictions.

### Breastplate

When targeted by a successful attack, you may negate the damage and damage your armor *or* roll a 1d6. On a 4+ you negate the damage and your armor is unharmed. On a roll of 1-3 you fail to reduce damage.

Against a mace, war hammer, or great club, you must roll 1d6 to determine if your armor protects you. These weapons always damage your armor. Wearing a breastplate causes fatigue unless you have the Armor Training.

### Hide Armor

Thick armor made from pelts, skins, shells or scales. Offers protection similar to light mail without the movement penalties; however, spears, bolts and arrows ignore the armor. In warm weather, wearing hide armor counts as a fatigue factor.

### Leather Bracers

Thick leather bands that serve to protect the wearer's wrists and forearms from injury. When used, roll 1d6: on 4-6, the bracers also prevent you from being disarmed.

Leather bracers may only be used once per conflict.

† Poor quality arms—Using poor quality arms incurs a +1 Ob penalty to all combat tests using the weapon.

º Superior quality arms—Use the superior quality weapon stats.

™ Must be mounted and have Mounted Combat Training.

### Bastard Sword

A well-balanced longsword that may be used either one-handed or two-handed.

### Bola

A simple hunting weapon used to entangle game or impede assailants. A successful test with a bola also grants impedes (+1 Ob) and immobilizes the victim. Unlike a sling, the bola itself is thrown; the wielder is disarmed until a new weapon is equipped. Bolas do not cause damage but grant +2D in Range and Cover maneuvers.

### Buckler

A small, round shield that doesn't impede your opportunity to attack.

### Harpoon

A large hunting spear used to capture large aquatic beasts. The harpoon lodges itself into its target's hide, then the barbed

tip detaches from the weapon's shaft. A line attached to the barb is often employed, allowing the thrower to impede

movement or drag the target to shore. Frostfolk use these weapons when fishing for large prey, whales or even sea serpents.

**Special:** Harpoons may be thrown short distances. On a hit, the target is impeded for as long as the thrower is holding onto the line—the harpoon cannot be used again that conflict. The target will remain impeded until the thrower drops the line or is disarmed.

### Hide Shield

Hide shields only negate damage on a roll of 5-6. If you negate damage, roll 1d6. The shield is damaged on a roll of 1-3. Hide shields act as 3-slot containers to store hand axes, daggers, or throwing blades.

### Javelin

Javelins are throwing weapons that bypass leather armor. You may carry a pair in your off hand, with or without a shield.

### Rapier

An ornate, thrusting sword made to pierce leather and hide. Unlike a sword, it cannot grant a bonus to defense.

### Sickle

Sickles are improvised weapons. Characters with tools for Peasant skills may carry a sickle as part of their skill tools without using a pack slot.

### Staff

This simple staff is easy to fabricate, inexpensive to purchase and inordinately useful as a tool or as an improvised weapon.

### Stiletto

A thrusting dagger designed to slide between ribs or through gaps in armor. A stiletto may be concealed on the body.

Attacks against an impeded, unarmed, or otherwise helpless opponent ignore armor.

### Throwing Blades

Throwing blades may be spikes, rings, stars or darts. One blade may be thrown per action. Unless you have multiple blades in hand, you're disarmed until you wield another weapon. Some blades may be disguised as clothing if you have slots available—a razor-edged belt buckle, a pair of spiky earrings or sharp hair pins.

### Whip

The whip is a long, braided leather thong with a wooden handle. A herding tool, it may also be used to intimidate wild animals and cause pain and trauma when striking unarmored or lightly armored opponents. A whip may be used like a rope swing to traverse hazards provided there's an anchoring point overhead. Using a whip turns an independent test to a versus test against melee weapons. It is less effective against opponents wearing armor—whips do no damage to armor or helmets.

| Sweater (wool)   | 2   | worn/torso 1                    | 1      |

### Belt

A belt is standard gear for all adventurers, but should one wear out, get stolen or be lost in a life-saving procedure, replacements are available.

Belts have three slots for pack 1 items, but they cannot be used to carry bundled items like torches, candles, spikes, etc.

### Boots

When traveling, boots grant +1D to tests resulting from rain or rough roads.

### Cloak

A cloak grants +1D to Survival or Health tests related to staying warm or keeping dry, including recovery tests.

### Clothing

Adventurers begin their career clothed, but the rigors of the road are such that on occasion one needs a new pair of pants. Clothes do not have any inventory requirement as adventurers wear them under their equipment (hopefully).

### Finery

Fine clothes are required for dealing with nobility or guild masters in town.

### Gloves (Leather)

Thick leather gloves grant +1D to tests to resist heat or injury from work, as well as +1D to tests involving hauling. However, they impose a +1 Ob factor for actions like spell casting, shooting, carving, etc.

### Hat

A hat grants +1D to tests for resisting the effects of sun and rain.

### Hat (Stylish)

Stylish hats provide +1D to Oratory, Persuasion, and Falsehood.

### Scarf

A scarf grants +1D to tests for resisting or recovering from the effects of cold and draft.

### Shoes

Shoes are great for walking across gravel and glass.

### Sweater (Wool)

A wool sweater grants +1D for resisting the effects of cold and wet. This bonus stacks with hats and scarves. Get toasty.

### Astrolabe

An ornate metal disc instrument used for measuring the position of celestial bodies. An astrolabe grants +1D to the Astrology, Cartography, and Orienteering skills as long as skies are clear.

A ball of twine can be used as supplies for tests when appropriate. Cost and inventory is for three supplies.

### Bandolier

Worn across the chest, an adventurer can hang three belt items on the bandolier—small pack 1 items that are not in bundles or containers (no rations, torches, candles, coins, gems, apples, etc.).

### Bedroll

A portable soft surface for resting during camp. Using a bedroll allows you to reroll one failed recovery die per camp phase when recovering from exhausted, injured or sick. In expedition conflicts, a bedroll grants +1D to Defend (Rest) actions.

### Bell

A small bell can be a useful tool for adventurers who need to set alarms or send signals.

### Chalk

Chalk is used to mark areas and acts as supplies for Cartography, Orienteering, and Streetwise tests when appropriate. Cost and inventory is for three supplies.

### Compass

An alchemical device that harnesses the æther to report true north reliably. Unlike the crude lodestone, it is precise enough to grant +1D to Cartography as well as Orienteering.

Certain magical and physical effects can cause the compass to malfunction.

### Flasks of oil

Lanterns use flasks of oil as fuel. Cost and inventory is for two flasks of oil. A flask of oil will fuel a lantern for three tests. See the Lantern entry.

### Flasks of Refined Oil

A flask of refined oil burns for one additional test in lanterns. In a standard lantern, refined oil burns for four tests. In a covered lantern it burns for five tests.

### Garlic

Garlic acts as supplies for Cooking.

### Grappling hook

A grappling hook (when used with rope) grants +1D to Climbing.

### Grooming Brush

Use this tool to help keep your animal healthy and calm. The grooming brush adds +1D to Animal Husbandry tests when helping a mount recover or calm down.

### Hammer

A hammer is used to drive iron spikes into hard surfaces, among other uses.

### Horseshoes

Shoes for horses. An unshod horse can develop serious problems (injured or sick condition) from walking on hard surfaces or bearing heavy loads. In addition to their intended purpose, innovative adventurers have found many other uses for these heavy, curved hunks of iron.

The listed price is for a set of four horseshoes.

### Ice Skates

These skates are made from the metatarsal bones of horses or cattle, made very flat and smooth on the bottom, and tied to the feet using leather thongs. A wooden pole with an iron spike on the bottom is used for balance and propulsion. Skates provide +1D to tests involving moving across ice.

### Iron spikes

Iron spikes grant +1D to tests involving wedging doors open or closed, climbing, anchoring ropes or prying things loose. Cost and inventory is for six spikes. When used, roll 1d6-1 for the number of spikes lost, bent, broken or stuck in the process.

### Key, Spare

A spare key can be fashioned to open any lock for which you have a key to copy. Most communities keep a close eye on their locksmiths, but thieves' guilds often employ unscrupulous sorts who will gladly duplicate stolen keys.

### Ladder

A ladder is used to safely ascend short, difficult climbs.

### Lock

Locks can be used to secure doors, chests and crates. The cost of the lock determines the obstacle for any Lock picking test to open it without the key.

The price of the lock includes a working key to open it. Additional keys are sold separately. A locked chest can still be carried off by a sufficient number of thieves.

### Lodestone

A crude hunk of mineral that is drawn to iron. When suspended from a cord, it roughly indicates the direction of north, although less reliably than a proper compass. The Lodestone grants +1D on Orienteering tests. It can also be used to capture small metal objects when held nearby.

### Mirror

A mirror is useful for reflecting, signaling or even peeking around a corner.

### Pole, 10'

A pole can be used as gear for detecting traps, climbing, measuring distances or rigging sails or tents. It can be used as supplies for building shelter.

### Pry Bar

A pry bar grants +1D to tests for opening doors, lifting lids and wedging things open. It can be used as an improvised weapon.

### Riding Saddle

A saddle is necessary for all but the most expert riders to control their mount. The price of a saddle includes all other necessary tack for riding. A saddle adds a single seat to the mount.

A weapon slot suitable for carrying a lance or similar arms can be added for an additional +1 Ob to the resources cost, resulting in a "war saddle."

### Rope

Rope comes in 50-foot coils. It is incredibly useful and can be used in situations involving climbing, linking your group together for a hike in the fog, tying down unruly captives and even starting fires.

### Sextant or Backstaff

The backstaff and sextant are further evolutions of the astrolabe, using a complex mechanism of mirrors and geometry to measure the position of celestial bodies as long as the skies are clear. They provide +1D to Cartography and Orienteering when skies are clear.

### Shovel

A shovel acts as gear when digging trenches, pits and graves. It can also be used as a weapon in a pinch.

### Skis

These skis are wood, with leather thongs for bindings. One ski is short and covered in fur, while the other is long. The short ski is used to push, while the long ski is slathered with animal fat and used to glide. A single stout, wood stick is often used for balance. Skis provide +1D to Hunting and Orienteering tests in snow, as well as any other tests that involve moving across snow at speed.

### Square-Back Hatchet

A square-back hatchet grants +1D to Peasant skills for clearing brush, chopping wood and pounding nails. It can be used as an improvised weapon in a pinch.

### Tallow Pot

Tallow is a sallow grease used as supplies for Alchemy and Survival tests requiring lubricant or an accelerant.

### Thieves' tools

Thieves' tools grant +1D to Lock picking tests to pick locks and to Munitions tests to disarm traps.

### Candle Lantern

This is a small lantern that houses a candle, rather than a reservoir of oil. Candles within it can be snuffed out or broken only as a twist. It can also be masked without dousing the light.

It provides light for one character and dim light for one other.

### Covered Lantern

A covered lantern houses a better wick and reservoir for its fuel oil. Covered lanterns can also be masked without dousing the light.

It provides light for three characters and dim light for three others, and its oil reservoir burns for four tests rather than three.

### Ghost Lantern

Ghost lanterns are made from paper or silk and lit by a single candle rather than a flask of oil. They serve to protect lit candles from wind and rain. A candle placed inside a ghost lantern cannot be snuffed out or blown out at the GM's whim.

Paper lanterns shield candles from wind while the more expensive, more durable cloth lanterns safeguard candles from both wind and rain. Ghost lanterns may be hung on the end of a staff or pole while traveling.

### Long Torch

A long torch is the length of a staff and must be carried with two hands. It provides light for two people (and dim light for two more) for four tests. They are sold in sets of two.

### Rushlights

Rushlights are bundles of dried reeds soaked in animal fat. They burn like candles but burn for 1d6 turns. If 1-2 is rolled, the rushlight provides light for an additional person. If 5-6 is rolled, it only provides dim light.
