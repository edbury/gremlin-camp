# The Scorching Desert

When the Old Ones still had dominion over the world, this was the green and verdant land where they made their home—or so the scholars say. Now, it is hard to imagine a less hospitable place. Winds carry heavy heat from where the bright yellow sun beats down upon the land. Ancient cities and the tombs of forgotten heroes lie buried under the dunes, concealed by sandstorms kicked up by the hot and wicked wind.

Though dangerous and unforgiving, there is a solitude to be found here among the ever-shifting sands. The Astronomical can be blessedly cool, refreshing even. Travel here at your own peril, and pray that there is a settlement beyond the next dune.

## Seasons

Tropical deserts experience two seasons­—Summer and Winter—both of which are exceedingly warm compared to temperate regions.

## Surviving the Desert

### Desert Garb

Desert travelers favor light fabrics with maximum coverage to protect from the sun. A hat or headgear is essential. Desert clothing can be bought in settlements near the desert for the price of a cloak. Cloaks from other regions are much too heavy. Each traveler without appropriate clothes adds one to the territory's Nature.

### Desert Roads

In most places, the long road is covered by dunes, and many of the most reliable routes through the desert are actually wadis. On such rare occasions as precipitation strikes, these wadis quickly fill with runoff draining from the sands. The rain or hailstones weather threats can drive you off the road in the Scorching Desert.

### Dry Heat

The desert heat is punishing. Travelers must consume a draught of water—not rations—in order to alleviate the hungry and thirsty condition. During an expedition, each character must consume a draught of water at the beginning of each round. If you do not, raise the Scorching Desert's Nature by one for each portion missed.

### Finding Water

When making camp in the desert, finding an adequate water supply is an additional three factors instead of one.

### Open Sky

There is a dearth of cover in the Scorching Desert, leaving travelers vulnerable to sudden changes in the weather. Once per expedition, explode any 6s rolled by a weather threat.
