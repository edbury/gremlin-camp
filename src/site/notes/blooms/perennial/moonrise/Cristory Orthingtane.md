# Cristory Orthingtane, Auctioneer & Tastemaker

"For the coming season, we shall be staging an exhibition of grave goods from the necropolis of Vanax. It would be splendid to have something unique for the collection."

::hidden
For decades, Madam Orthingtane has dictated the aesthetic trends followed by the idle rich of Highwater. Her gallery displays the collected treasure from many ages and realms of Feudor, and she's always eager for opportunities to add artifacts to her ever-growing collection.

Some claim she's lived a conspicuously long life and point to her pallid skin and the odd hours she keeps as evidence of sinister goings-on. No matter what the secret is to her continued vitality, clients, patrons and visitors alike find her to be disarmingly warm and generous.

## Beliefs

1. My gallery must house the most unique and powerful artifacts in all of the Twilight.
2. The stolen figurine is a prize I must acquire, no matter the cost.
3. I will use my influence to shape the tastes of Highwater's elite and maintain my position.

## Instincts

1. Always appraise the value and uniqueness of any artifact I encounter.
2. When negotiating for an item, start with flattery before making an offer.
3. If questioned about my age or vitality, deflect with charm and change the subject.

## Traits

Capricious, Genteel, Obliging
