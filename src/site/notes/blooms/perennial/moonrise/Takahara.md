# Takahara

Rising within an ancient volcanic crater, Takahara ascends in three concentric rings divided by walls and gardens. Floating islands of stone drift between districts like slow clouds. At the city's heart, the Jinju Tree towers above the Noble Quarter, its branches sheltering the Eternal Emperor's pagoda. The air is thick with incense, cherry blossoms, and the quiet toll of temple bells.
