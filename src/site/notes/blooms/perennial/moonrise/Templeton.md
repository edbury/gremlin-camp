# Templeton

Along the grand Mall of Saints, the remnants of a forgotten age stand as a testament to a time when gods walked the earth. Now, these temples are more like shrines or monuments, dedicated to the legends, heroes, and ancestral spirits of the past.

Each temple advertises its services with ornate carvings and relics, all promising some future benefit in exchange for a tribute to the memory of a legendary figure. Certain of the shrines provide additional services to the populace, though their true power is often debated.

## The Law: Blasphemy

Speak not the names of the old gods, for they are forgotten. Instead, honor the legends by their deeds and domains.

Blasphemers who disrespect these ancient legends are publicly humiliated in the stocks or gibbet, and repeat offenders are tried and burned at the stake for desecrating the memory of the ancestors.
