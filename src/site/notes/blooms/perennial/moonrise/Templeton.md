# Templeton

Along the grand Mall of Saints, temples to a hundred Forgotten Lords advertise their services with ornate idols and obelisks, all promising some future miracle in exchange for a donation to their patron Lord. Certain of the temples provide an additional service to the laity.

## The Law: Blasphemy

Speak not the names of the Lords, but know them by their dominions. 

Blasphemers are publicly humiliated in the stocks or gibbet, and repeat offenders will be tried and burned at the stake.
