## Workout Routine

### 1. Cardiovascular Exercise (20-30 minutes):

Choose one or a combination of the following exercises to elevate your heart rate and burn calories:

- **Brisk walking or jogging in place**:
    - Lift your knees and swing your arms as if you were running, but without moving forward.
- **High knees or marching in place**:
    - March on the spot, lifting your knees as high as possible with each step.
- **Jumping jacks**:
    - Start with your feet together and hands at your sides.
    - Jump up, spreading your feet shoulder-width apart and raising your arms overhead.
    - Jump again to return to the starting position.
- **Burpees (bodyweight squat thrusts)**:
    - Start in a standing position.
    - Squat down, place your hands on the floor, kick your feet back into a high plank position, perform a push-up, jump your feet back to the squat position, and jump explosively into the air with your arms raised.
- **Mountain climbers**:
    - Start in a high plank position.
    - Bring one knee towards your chest, then quickly switch legs in a running motion, keeping your core engaged and hips level.
- **Jumping rope (imaginary if you don't have a rope)**:

- **Dancing or aerobics routines**:
    - Follow along with dance or aerobic routines, incorporating movements that get your heart rate up.

Perform the chosen exercise(s) for 20-30 minutes, aiming for a moderate to high intensity level. Start with a duration that challenges you but is sustainable, then gradually increase the time as your fitness improves.

Perform a circuit of bodyweight exercises targeting different muscle groups. Complete as many rounds as possible within the allotted time:

- **Push-ups**:

    - Repeat on the other leg, alternating sides with each rep.
    - Recommended reps: 10-15 per leg

    - Lie on your back with your hands behind your head and your legs bent, feet lifted off the ground.
