> Traditional laboratory science looks for the best explanation for phenomena, which leads to an emphasis on singular causality.

> The principle of equifinality shows that a child's problem can result from a variety of starting points and that within an open system it is likely that several factors have contributed to the problem. This realization can both cut through defensiveness and help parents understand that improved parenting can be part of the solution to the child's problem.

> Current family treatments for schizophrenia highlight the importance of reducing negative expressed emotion, which highlights a circular causality model (C.M. Anderson, 1986). Within this model, families learn that as there is increased symptomatology in the system, family members may all experience greater anxiety and affect. If this affect is expressed directly, it is likely to exacerbate psychotic symptomatology, which in turn generates greater negative affect. By reducing these negative affective chains, families with schizophrenic members reduce distress as well as psychotic symptoms. Rather than blaming the family for the symptoms, this approach highlights the ways that family members can escape patterns of negatively triggering one another.

> There is a similar challenge in helping couples recover from affairs. To begin the healing process, it is frequently necessary for the person who had the affair to be fully accountable for betraying the relationship and causing the breach in trust (Pittman, 1989). By taking complete responsibility for having the affair, the partner who violated the relationship can begin to regain the trust of the wronged partner and in that process can often restore a sense of integrity in owning the wrongdoing. As the work continues, it may also involve looking at problems in the relationship for which both members were responsible. There is a delicate balance between allowing the affair partner to take responsibility for the affair and helping both partners own problems in the relationship.

> …Patterson recognized that operant and classical conditioning go hand in hand in these situations. He pointed out that when negative behavioral cycles persist, family members become aversive stimuli for on another (Patterson, 1970). The classical conditioning that occurs further solidifies the operant conditioning; for example, as parents feel upset by their child's behavior, they feel anger and anxiety, and the mere presence of the child elicits a painful negative emotion. Trying to avoid that feeling, parents keep an emotional distance from the child that is also experienced negatively by the child. When given requests or directives, the child is not motivated by a positive relationship to comply. Instead, the request is perceived negatively and ignored until the parent becomes frustrated enough to pay a great deal of attention to the child. When the parent is acting in some extreme manner, the child finally complies. This prototypical example shows that the parent has trained the child to ignore requests initially (reinforcing the behavior after many requests), while the child has trained the parent to go to extremes to get his attention. In addition, the outcome of this cycle is that each party feels anxious and upset in the presence of the other. Patterson points out that the key behavioral efficacy that each party has in this cycle is aversive control (Patterson, 1993).

> In several well-replicated studies, Gottman documents the importance of the balance between positive and negative interactional cycles. Again highlighting the complementary nature of operant and classical conditioning, Gottman notes that positive and negative affective cycles tend to be self-reinforcing. In addition, Gottman stresses the power of negative interactional cycles. Overall, it takes five positive interactions to counteract the effect of one negative interaction. Gottman's more recent work helps us understand why couples can become so stuck in either positive or negative cycles. He notes that in happy couples, a negative interaction frequently does not start a negative cycle. He calls this phenomenon the ability to up-regulate positive affect during conflict.

> Further, in my experience, the emphasis on multiple and circular causality is a huge component of successful therapy because it replaces blame with responsibility. This shift from shame and defensiveness to genuine regret and accountability is equally helpful in working with individuals, couples, or families. Most of us harbor primitive and profound wishes to be completely blameless in our life's problems and simultaneously fear that we are totally at fault for our own misery. To be able to step back and acknowledge that there are numerous contributors to our problems takes the idea of context a step further…By recognizing multiple contributions to a problem, we can move away from a posture of blame to create an atmosphere of understanding and problem solving. In addition, by adding the concept of circular causality, we see that frequently the pattern created in a negative cycle keeps a problem locked in place. To be able to say, "You have developed a pattern in which you bring out the worst in each other" is not only less blaming; it also offers a focus on problem behavior rather than problem people.
