# Shred's Guide to House Sitting

Thank you for agreeing to look after our place and little Lemmy while we're gone! Hopefully, this will give you all the info you need for accessing our place and staying comfy.

## The basics

Our address is **3900 Adeline Street, Oakland, CA 94608**.

We are in apartment **318**.

The gate code is "#8675".

The wifi network is `blunderdome` and the password is "ghostpoops".

## Getting in 

The main entrance is on **Adeline Street** between **Yerba Buena Avenue** and **39th Street**. It's a large, rust-colored gate.

Free parking is available on **39th** and **Yerba Buena**--just be aware of street sweeping. Both of these streets have separate, smaller entrances you can also use.

The gate code to enter the complex is "#8675" (the first four digits of Jenny's phone number).

From the main entrance, you can take an elevator on your left up to the third floor. Out of the elevator, turn left to cross a small skyway. Our apartment is straight ahead at the end of the hall.

## Lemmy

The little one is pretty shy, so don't take it personally if she spends most of her time under the couch while we're gone. If you're hungry for some kitty cuddles, she tends to warm up to folks more quickly when they're laying down.

Her fountain is topped off, and her litter boxes are clean, so you don't have to worry about managing those.

### Feeding the baby

Lem enjoys a hearty diet of raw turkey. Thankfully, it doesn't stink like most wet food.

She isn't on a strict feeding schedule and usually eats 3 to 4 times a day when we do. I'll also give her a serving before I go to bed. 

Mealtime is simple. You'll find two yellow-topped containers in the fridge full of thawed kitty food. There are markings along the side to indicate a serving size; she gets one serving per meal. They don't have to be perfect; I just wipe any leftovers out of her bowl and portion the next meal with a normal spoon.

Since her food is fridge-cold, I pop her bowl in the microwave for 15 seconds before giving it to her.

## Amenities

Mi casa es su casa. Feel free to make use of the TV, PS5, record player, and laundry. The house isn't usually well-stocked but you're welcome to eat or drink anything in the kitchen.

### Wifi

The network name is `blunderdome` and the password is "ghostpoops".

### TV

If you want to watch some TV, the PS5 has apps for HBO, Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon. Any of the gaming controllers will turn the PS5 on if you press the middle button between the joysticks.

To get the TV and speakers on, use the skinny remote--everything should come alive ready for use.
