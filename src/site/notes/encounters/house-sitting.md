# Shred's Guide to House Sitting

## The basics

Our address is **3900 Adeline Street, Oakland, CA 94608**.

We are in apartment **318**.

The gate code is **#8675**.

The wifi password is `ghostpoops`.

## Getting in 

The main entrance is on **Adeline Street** between **Yerba Buena Avenue** and **39th Street**. It's a large, rust-colored gate.

Free parking is available on **39th** and **Yerba Buena**--just be aware of street sweeping. Both of these streets have separate, smaller entrances.

The gate code to enter the complex is **#8675** (the first four digits of Jenny's phone number).

From the main entrance, you can take an elevator on your left up to the third floor. Out of the elevator, turn left to cross a small skyway. Our apartment is straight ahead at the end of the hall.
